\chapter{Homotopy Groups}

We will find the Dirac Quantization Condition is equivalent to the fact that principal $S^1$ bundles over the $2$-sphere are in $1-1$ correspondence with the elements of the fundamental group of the circle.

Central Result: Homotopy Lifting Theorem for locally trivial bundles => find all $\pi_n(S^1)$; classify $G$-principal bundles of $S^n$.
