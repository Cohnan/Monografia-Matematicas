\chapter{Differentiable Manifolds and Matrix Lie Groups}

Explicitly calculated the Lie algebras of important Matrix Lie Groups.

Cartan $1$-form $\Theta$ (lie algebra valued $1$-form on $G$) explicity calculations.

When looking at the $2$ hopf bundles are studied, and the Monopole v.fields and BPST instanton solutions to Yang mills equatios found ARISE as parts of the Maurer-Cartan form.


Anti-self dual connection on big Hopf bundle: CRUCIAL.
