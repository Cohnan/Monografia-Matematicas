\chapter{Path Connections and Lie Theory}

This chapter deals with the process by which an infinitesimal connection in the Lie algebroid of a locally trivial Lie groupoid (like that of a transitive Lie algebroid) may be INTEGRATED to a law of path lifting (frpom $M$ to $\Omega$), i.e. to a \emph{path connection}

\section{\rtext{Path Connections}}

Abstract formulation of: in the case of a transitive Lie algebroid $A$ of a (necessarily locally trivial) Lie groupoid $\Omega$ over $M$, a connection in $A$ induces a means of lifting paths in $M$ to paths in $\Omega$: path connection in $\Omega$.

... so, it turns out that this isn't really that important to me.

\section{\rtext{The Abstract Theory of Transitive Lie Algebroids}}

Adjoint bundle of transitive Lie algebroid is an LAB. (easy)

\quad The adjoint representation of of $A$ on $L$ $ad:A \to \mathcal D(L)$ takes values in $D_{Der}(L)$

If $\phi: A \to A'$  is a base-preserving morphism of Lie algebroids, then $\phi^+:L \to L'$ is locally constant. -> Significant algebraic theory of transitive Lie algebroids.

Some fundamental results to the cohomology theory, and to the development of the algebraic theory of transitive Lie algebroids.
