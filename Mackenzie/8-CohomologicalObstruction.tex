\chapter{The Cohomological Obstruction to Integrability}

This chapter is concerned with the integrability problem for transitive Lie algebroids, and the single cohomological obstruction which gives a complete solution in that case.

\quad For general Lie algebroids, the problem of integrability has recently been completely solved.

8.1: Rapid summary of a simple and interesting case, known from geometric prequantization.

8.2: Transitive Lie algebroid on a contractible base admits flat connection ->(5.4) \rtext{every transitive Lie algebroid is locally trivial}.

\quad Leas to Classification of transitive Lie algebroids in terms of what's called Systems of transition data. This classification is an exact infinitesimal analogue of the Classification of principal bundles by Transition functions.
