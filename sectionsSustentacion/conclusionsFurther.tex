\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
- Two easy generalizations: $\tau$ and other algebroids

- No need for new tools like Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

- Background connections now becomes relevant, so there are multiple $A$ fields in the equations.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Further Work}
    - $\tau$ fields fixed to reproduce the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory for electroweak interactions.
    
    - Gauge group
    
    - Quantization
    
    - Transformation laws under gauge transformations
    
    - Simple Lie algebroids different to Atiyah Lie algebroids
