Fernandes remarks that it is thanks to the Lie braket that it is possible to make this kind of Cartan calculi.

Why is it necessary? What does this mean? What does it allow?

What is the difference, if any, with connection theory?

Relation between exterior derivative and usual covariant derivative:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Finer than $d$: requiring $TM$ necessarily, because it is based on a connection $TM \to \mathcal D(E)$
    
    \item Coarser than $d$: does not require a representation, a connection doesn't have to be a homomorphism of Lie algebras.
        
    \end{itemize}

Why relevant to me:
    \begin{itemize}
        
    \item Vector calculus?
    
    \item What can be integrated. Inner integration generates usual (vector bundle valued) forms on the base manifold.
    
    \item Algebroid connections are ``normalized'' elements $ \omega \in \Omega^1(A, L)$, and their curvature is $d\omega \in \Omega^2(A, L)$. Generalized connections are precisely the elements of $\Omega^1(A, L)$.
    
    \item When talking about matter fields, a generalized connection $\hat \omega$ induces covariant derivatives $\hat \nabla^E: \Gamma(E) \to \mathbf{\Omega^1(A, E)}$, so that $\hat \nabla^E \phi \in \Omega^1(A, E)$.
    
    \item $\Omega^\bullet(A)$ is used to do cohomology on Lie algebroids
    
    \item In each $\Omega^p(A, L)$ the natural scalar product $(\omega, \eta) = \cl{\omega, \star \eta} = \int_A h(\omega, \star \eta)$, for $h$ in inner metric, is what will be used to define the gauge action:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            
        \item For $\hat \omega \in \Omega^1(A, L)$, define $S_{Gauge}[\hat \omega] = (\hat R, \hat R)$
        
        \item For $\phi \in \Gamma(E)$ and $\hat \omega$ as above, $S_{Matter}[\phi, \hat \omega] := (\hat \nabla^E \phi, \hat \nabla^E \phi)$
        
        \end{itemize}
        
    \end{itemize}

TODO\todo{check this}: the third ``important example'' introduced in Lazzarini is important to me? $A$ connections on $E$ are used to define finite gauge transformations, which somehow induce the infinitesimal gauge transformation definition on generalized connections? If not for this, $A$-connections, and so this examples, are of no relevance to me.

Throughout this section, let $A$ be a Lie algebroid over the manifold $M$ with anchor $a$.

\begin{definition}
Let $E$ be a vector bundle over $M$. We now define some vector bundles over $M$.
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Let \emph{$\Alt^0(A, E)$}$:= E$. 
    
    \item For $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 1}$, let \emph{$\Alt^n(A, E)$} be the natural embedding, as alternating maps, of the (hom-)bundle $\Hom(\bigwedge^n A, E)$ into the vector bundle $\Hom(\bigoplus^n A, E)$ (as defined according to \ref{}) over $M$. Its fiber at $m \in M$ is, then, the vector space of alternating linear transformations $\{\omega: \underbrace{A_m \times \cdots \times A_m}_{\text{$n$ times}} \to E_m \st \text{$\omega$ is $\RR$-linear and alternating}\}$.
    
    \item Let \emph{$\Alt^\bullet(A, E)$}$:= \bigoplus^\infty_{n = 0} \Alt^n(A, E)$.
    % OJO: i can't call this forms, since forms are either C^\infty M multilinear, or complete vector bundle morphisms!
    
    %\item For $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$, let \emph{$\Alt^n(A)$} and \emph{$Alt^\bullet (A)$} be the application of the previous definitions to the trivial vector bundle $E = M \times \RR$.
        
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
A local section over the open $U \subset M$ of a hom-bundle $\Hom(E, E')$, for $E$ and $E'$ vector bundles over $M$, is a vector bundle morphism $:E|_U \to E|_{U'}$ between vector bundles over $U$. Naturally, then, the elements of $\Gamma_U(\Hom(E, E'))$ are equivalent to $C^\infty(U)$-linear maps $: \Gamma_U(E) \to \Gamma_U(E)$. 

Notice, that a local section of a hom-bundle $\Hom(E, E')$ need not have an extension to a full vector bundle morphism $:E \to E'$.\todo{Even if only on $A = TS^2$, in which case we have the usual manifold theory of forms, $\partial_\phi$ is part of a local frame BUT can't be extended to a global vector field, it still defines a ``local form'' $d\phi \in \Omega_{U_{SN}}(M)$}
\end{remark}

Notice that $\Alt^\bullet(A, E)$ is indeed a vector bundle, with finite dimensional fibers, since, if $U \subset M$ is a trivializing neighborhood of both $A$ and $E$ with fibers $V$ and $W$ respectively, $\Alt^\bullet(A, E)|_U \cong U \times Hom(V, \bigwedge^* W)$ is a trivial vector bundle.

\begin{definition}
Let $E$ be a vector bundle over $M$ on which there is a representation $\phi: A \to \alg D(E)$ of $A$. Let $U \subset M$ be open:\todo{Open? Doesn't matter? I care about $U$ open only. RTA: to know what a smooth local section is, we prefer $U$ to be open}.

    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item For $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$, define the $C^\infty(U)$-module \emph{\lbtext{$\Omega_U^n(A, E)$}}$:= \Gamma_U\Alt^n(A, E)$. Its elements are called \emph{local $E$-valued $n$-forms on $A$ over $U$}. If $U = M$, simply write \emph{$\Omega^n(A, E)$} and call its elements \emph{$E$-valued $n$-forms on $A$}.
    
    \item Define the $C^\infty(U)$-module $\emph{\Omega_U^\bullet(A, E)} := \bigoplus^\infty_{n = 0} \Omega_U^n(A, E)$. Its elements are simply called \emph{local $E$-valued forms on $A$ over $U$}. If $U = M$, simply write $\emph{\Omega^\bullet(A, E)}$ and call its elements \emph{$E$-valued forms on $A$.}
    
    %\item \item For $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$, let \emph{$\Omega^n(A)$}$:= \Gamma\Alt^n(A)$. 
    
    %\item Define the $C^\infty(M)$-module $\emph{\Omega^\bullet(A)} := \bigoplus^\infty_{n = 0} \Omega^n(A)$.
        
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Due to the bijective correspondence between $C^\infty(U)$-linear maps between local sections over $U$ of vector bundles and vector bundle morphisms of the bundles restricted to $U$\todo{Pretty sure this a thing. A local form need not be extendable to a global form, in the same way that the local vector field $\partial_\phi$ can not be extended to all $S^2$}, $\Omega_U^n(A, E)$ may be considered the space of $C^\infty(U)$-multilinear antisymmetric maps from $\Gamma_U(A)^n$ to $\Gamma_U(E) = \Omega_U^0(A, E)$. We will refer as \ptext{(local) $E$-valued $n$-forms on $A$} to both
\begin{align}
    \omega &: \underbrace{A|_U \oplus \cdots \oplus A|_U}_{\text{$n$ times}} \to E|_U, & \text{alternating, $\RR$-vector bundle morphism and}\\
    \omega &: \underbrace{\Gamma_U(A) \times \cdots \times \Gamma_U(A)}_{\text{$n$ times}} \to \Gamma_U(E) & \text{alternating, \dbtext{$C^\infty(U)$}-multilinear map}.
\end{align}
    
    %\item $\Omega^n(A)$ may be considered the space of $C^\infty(M)$-multilinear antisymmetric maps from $\Gamma(A)^n$ to $C^\infty(M)$.
    
\end{remark}

\lin



\begin{example}
On the trivial vector bundle $M \times \bb K$\todo{$A$ as a $\bb K$ vector bundle}, the associated space of forms on $A$ is denoted by $\lbtext{\lbtext{\Omega^\bullet(A)}}$, and it is called the \lbtext{space of scalar valued forms on $A$}. Notice that the module $\Omega^n(A) = \Gamma \bigwedge^n A^*$.

This is the fundamental example of forms on an algebroid $A$. It has been used to define a cohomology theory on Lie algebroids and \todo{complement}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $0 \to L \xrightarrow{j} A \xrightarrow{a} TM \to 0$ be a transitive Lie algebroid sequence.
The space $\lbtext{\Omega^\bullet(A, L)}$ of $L$-valued forms on $A$ will be an important example since (generalized) algebroid connections and their curvatures are particular cases of this type of forms on $A$.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}\label{isomorphOmega}
Let $U\subset M$ be open:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item $\Alt^n(A, E)|_U$ and $E|_U \otimes \bigwedge^n A^*|_U$ are isomorphic vector bundles.
    
    %\item $\Alt^n(A)$ and $\bigwedge^n A^*$ are isomorphic vector bundles.
    
    \item \rtext{$\Omega_U^n(A, E)$ and $\Gamma_U(E) \otimes \Omega_U^n(A)$ are isomorphic} $C^\infty(U)$-modules.
    
    \item If $U$ is trivializing neighborhood for both $A$ and $E$, $\rtext{\Omega_U^n(A, E)} \cong C^\infty(U, V) \otimes_{C^\infty(U)} \Gamma(U \times \bigwedge^n W^*) \rtext{\cong C^\infty(U, V) \otimes_{C^\infty(M)} C^\infty\left(U, \bigwedge^n W^* \right) } \cong \rtext{ C^\infty(U, V) \otimes_{\bb K} \bigwedge^n W^*}$.
    
    %\item $\Omega^n(A)$ and $\Gamma\Alt^nA^*$ are isomorphic $C^\infty(M)$-modules.
    
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We may assume simply that $U = M$, since using an arbitrary $U$ simply means that we are working on manifolds over $U$. $\Alt^n(A, E) \cong \Hom(\bigwedge^n A, E)$ by definition, and $\Hom(\bigwedge^n A, E) \cong E \otimes (\bigwedge^n A)* \cong E \otimes \bigwedge^n A^*$, but $\bigwedge^n A^* = \Omega^n(A)$.

Since $\Gamma$ is a strong monoidal function\todo{can I make this more clear?}, it distributes over the tensor product, and so the result follows from the first part of the theorem.
\end{proof}

Let $A = TM \oplus (M \times \alg g)$ be a trivial Lie algebroid over the manifold $M$, with $\alg g$ a Lie algebra.

\begin{proposition}\label{propIsoScalarFormsTLA}
The $C^\infty(M)$-module of $\bb K$-valued forms on the trivial Lie algebroid bundle $TM \times \alg g$ is isomorphic\todo{even equal} to $\Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes_{\bb K} \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^* = \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes_{C^\infty(M)} C^\infty(M, \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^*)$. The isomorphism, defined by linear extension of
\begin{align*}
    \Omega^r(TM) \otimes C^\infty(U, \bigwedge^s \alg g^*) &\to \Omega^{r+s}(TM \times \alg g)\\
    \alpha \otimes \beta &\mapsto \tilde \alpha \wedge \tilde \beta
\end{align*} where, for any $\alpha \in \Omega^r(TM)$ $r, s \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$:
\begin{align*}
    \tilde \alpha: (\Gamma(TM) \times C^\infty(M, \alg g)) \times \cdots (\Gamma(TM) \times C^\infty(M, \alg g)) &\to C^\infty(M) \\
    (X_1 \oplus \tilde \eta_1, \dots, X_r \oplus \tilde \eta_r) &\mapsto \alpha(X_1, \dots, X_r)
\end{align*} and for any $\beta \in C^\infty(M, \bigwedge^s \alg g^*)$:
\begin{align*}
    \tilde \beta: (\Gamma(TM) \times C^\infty(M, \alg g)) \times \cdots (\Gamma(TM) \times C^\infty(M, \alg g)) &\to C^\infty(M) \\
    (X_1 \oplus \tilde \eta_1, \dots, X_s \oplus \tilde \eta_s) &\mapsto \beta(\tilde \eta_1, \dots, \tilde \eta_s)
\end{align*}
is compatible with the grading, where the set of homogeneous elements of degree $p \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$ are $\sum_{r + s = p} \Omega^r(TU) \otimes_{C^\infty(M)} C^\infty(M, \bigwedge^s \alg g^*)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
The previous isomorphism between $\Omega^\bullet(TM \times \alg g)$ and $\Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes_{\bb K} \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^*$ can, and will, be used to define a $C^\infty(M)$-linear multiplication $\lbtext{\wedge}$ on $\Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes_{\bb K} \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^*$ which is compatible with the gradings. 

Furthermore, this isomorphisms allows us to see $\Omega^\bullet(TM)$ and $C^\infty(M, \alg g)$ as subsets of $\Omega^\bullet(TM \times \alg g)$. Abusing notation we may ignore the $~$'s of the mapping to simply state that, for $\alpha \in \Omega^r(TM)$ and $\beta \in C^\infty(M)\otimes_{\bb K} \bigwedge^s \alg g^*$, $r, s \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$, \ptext{$\alpha \wedge \beta \in \Omega^{r+s}(TM \times \alg g)$}.

\begin{definition}
Let

    d: \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^* &\to \Omega^{\bullet+1}(TM) \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^*\\

\begin{multline}
    s\beta(\sect \eta_1, \cdots, \sect \eta_{p+1}) := \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq p+1} (-1)^{i+j} \beta([\sect \eta_i, \sect \eta_j], \sect \eta_1, \cdots, \overset{\vee}{\sect \eta_i}, \cdots, \overset{\vee}{\sect \eta_j}, \cdots \sect \eta_{p+1})

be \emph{the Chevalley-Eilenbert differential on $\bigwedge \alg g^*$}, applied to the second factor. On $\Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^*$ define the $C^\infty(M)$-linear endomorphism $\lbtext{\hat d_{triv}}$:
\begin{align}
    \hat d_{triv}: \Omega^r(TM) \otimes \bigwedge^s \alg g^* &\to \left( \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^*\right)^{r+s+1} \\
    \alpha \otimes \beta = \alpha \wedge \beta &\mapsto  \hat d_{triv} (\alpha \wedge \beta) := d\alpha \wedge \beta + (-1)^|\alpha| \alpha \wedge s\beta \\

    1 \otimes \beta &\mapsto \hat d_{triv}\beta = s\beta \in 1 \otimes \bigwedge^{s+1} \alg g^*.
\end{align} $\hat d_{triv}$ is sometimes also denoted by $d+s$ in the literature.

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{theoIsoScalarFormsTLA}
\rtext{$(\Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet, \wedge, \hat d_{triv})$ is a (bi)graded (commutative) differential algebra and a graded differential module over $\Omega^\bullet(TM \times \alg g)$, isomorphic to the space $(\Omega^\bullet(TM \times \alg g), \wedge, \hat d_{TM \times \alg g})$} of $\bb K$-valued forms on the trivial Lie algebroid $TM \times \alg g$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
To see:

Graded module: done already, pretty much by definition of wedge, when restricting to the ``subspace'' $\Omega^\bullet(TM)$ in the first entry.

$\hat d_{triv}$ is a differential of module and algebra: pretty much by definition

Is isomorphism of graded modules: Respects the differentials DO!\todo{Done in my handwritten notes.}

Is isomorphism of graded algebras: Respects the wedge product: by definition of the wedge on the new space as defined in the remark following theorem \ref{propIsoScalarFormsTLA}.
\end{proof}

\ptext{Due to this isomorphism, from now on we will call $(\Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^*, \wedge, \hat d_{triv})$ the space of scalar valued forms on the trivial Lie algebroid $TM \times \alg g$, and $\Omega^\bullet(TM)$ and $C^\infty(M, \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g*)$ as subspaces.}

\linea

We now apply a similar result to the $L$-valued forms on the trivial Lie algebroid $A = TM \times \alg g$.

\begin{theorem}
The $C^\infty(M)$-module $\Omega(TM \times \alg g, M \times \alg g)$ of $M \times \alg g$-valued forms on the trivial Lie algebroid bundle $TM \times \alg g$, is isomorphic to $\Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right)$, and this isomorphism is compatible with the grading, where the set of homogeneous elements of degree $p \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$ is $\left( \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right) \right)^p = \sum_{r + s = p} \Omega^r(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^s \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right)$. 

\todo{not clear where it comes from, perhaps after $d$}This isomorphism induces a $C^\infty(M)$-multilinear mapping
\begin{equation}
    \wedge: \Omega^\bullet(TM) \times \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^s \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right)
    \to 
    \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^s \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right).
\end{equation}

Furthermore, defining the $C^\infty(M)$-linear endomorphism $\hat d$ on this space, 
\begin{align}
    \hat d: \Omega^r(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^s \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right) &\to \left( \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right)\right)^{r+s+1} \\
    \alpha \otimes \beta = \alpha \wedge \beta &\mapsto  \hat d (\alpha \wedge \beta) := d\alpha \wedge \beta + (-1)^|\alpha| \alpha \wedge s'\beta \\
    \alpha \otimes 1 &\mapsto \hat d\alpha = d\alpha \in \Omega^{r+1}(TM) \otimes 1 \\
    1 \otimes \beta &\mapsto \hat d\beta = s'\beta \in 1 \otimes \bigwedge^{s+1} \alg g^*.
\end{align}
where $d$ is the deRhan cohomology differential applied to the first factor, and, similarly, $s'$ is the \emph{the Chevalley-Eilenbert differential on the $\alg g$-valued forms $\bigwedge \alg g^* \otimes \alg g$} applied to the second factor. This last mapping satisfies
\begin{align*}
    s': \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right) &\to \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^{\bullet+1} \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right),
\end{align*} when applied to functions $\eta_i \in C^\infty(M, \alg g)$, gives the $\alg g$-valued function
\begin{multline}
    s'\omega(\sect \eta_1, \cdots, \sect \eta_{p+1}) := \sum_{i = 0}^{p+1} (-1)^i [g_i, \omega(\sect \eta_1, \cdots, \overset{\vee}{\sect \eta_i}, \cdots, \sect \eta_{p+1})] \\
    \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq p+1} (-1)^{i+j} \omega([\sect \eta_i, \sect \eta_j], \sect \eta_1, \cdots, \overset{\vee}{\sect \eta_i}, \cdots, \overset{\vee}{\sect \eta_j}, \cdots \sect \eta_{p+1}).
\end{multline}

Finally, \rtext{$\left( \Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right), \hat d \right)$ is a graded differential module over $\Omega^\bullet(M)$ under the $\wedge$ product, isomorphic to $(\Omega^\bullet(TM \times \alg g, M \times \alg g), \hat d)$}.
\end{theorem}

\ptext{Due to this isomorphism, from now on we will call $(\Omega^\bullet(TM) \otimes \left(\bigwedge^\bullet \alg g^* \otimes \alg g\right), \hat d)$ the space of $\alg g$-valued forms on the trivial Lie algebroid $TM \times \alg g$, and $\Omega^\bullet(TM)$, $\Omega^\bullet(TM)\otimes \alg g$, $C^\infty(M, \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g*)$ and $C^\infty(M, \bigwedge^\bullet \alg g*)\otimes \alg g$ as subspaces.}

\section{Local Description of ($\bb K$ and $L$ valued) forms on Transitive Lie Algebroids}

\begin{itemize}
    
\item Local trivialization of a form $\omega \mapsto \omega_{loc}$

\item $d_{TLA}\omega_{loc} = (d \omega)_{loc}$

\item $\hat \alpha^i_j$ for both real and $L$ valued forms.

\item Respects $d$. So $\hat \alpha$ is isomorphism of differential graded algebras.

\item $G^i_j$, matrix representation of $\hat \alpha^i_j$. Real valued, and $L$-valued:
    \begin{align}
        \omega^i_{\mu_1 \cdots a_1 \cdots a_s} &= G\cdots G \alpha^i_j(\omega^j_{\mu_1 \cdots b_1}) \\
        \omega^i_{\mu_1 \cdots a_1 \cdots a_s} &= G\cdots G \omega^j_{\mu_1 \cdots b_1}
    \end{align}

\item For Atiyah... for example, how does $G$ look. $\omega^i_{loc} = s_i^* \hat \omega$
    
\end{itemize}



Let $0 \to L \xrightarrow{j} A \xrightarrow{a} TM \to 0$ be an Atiyah sequenece of the transitive Lie algebroid $A$ over $M$. Let $\{(U_i, \psi_i: U_i \times \alg g \to L|_{U_i}, \Theta^i: TU_i \to A|_{U_i})\}_{i \in I}$ be a Lie algebroid atlas for $A$.

\begin{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item For each $i \in I$ define the local $q$-form $\omega^i_{loc}$ by
    \begin{align}
        \omega^i_{loc} = \omega \circ \Theta^i  \quad \in \Omega^q(TU_i\times \alg g)
    \end{align}
    
    \item A \emph{family of trivializations of $\omega$} is a set $\{\omega^i_{loc} \in \Omega^q(TU_i \times \alg g)\}$.

\begin{definition}
Let $\omega \in \Omega^q(A, L)$.
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item For each $i \in I$ define the local $q$-form $\omega^i_{loc}$ by
    \begin{align}
        \omega^i_{loc} = \psi_i^{-1} \circ \omega \circ \Theta^i  \quad \in \Omega^q(TU_i\times \alg g, U_i \times \alg g) \equiv \Omega^q_{TLA}(U_i, \alg g)
    \end{align}
    
    \item A \emph{family of trivializations of $\omega$} is a set $\{\omega^i_{loc} \in \Omega^q_{TLA}(U_i, \alg g)\}$.
    
    \end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $U$ be a Lie algebroid trivializing neighborhood of $A$ \textbf{that also trivializes $M$}, with associated trivializing maps $\psi: U \times \alg g \to L|_{U}$, $\Theta: TU \to A_{U}$, and let $\varphi = (x^1, \dots, x^m): U \to \RR^m$ be a coordinate map of $M$, and let $\set{E_a}_{a= 1, \dots, n}$ be a basis for $\alg g$. Then 
\begin{multline}
    \sectoid A_1, \dots, \sectoid A_m, \sectoid A_{m+1}, \dots, \sectoid A_{m+n} =\\
    \{S\left(\pder{x^1}\right), \dots, S\left(\pder{x^m}\right), S(\stilde{E_1}), \dots, S(\stilde{E_m}))\} \subset \Gamma_U(A)
\end{multline}
is a local frame for $A$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For every $m \in U$, $S$ is fiberwise a vector space isomorphism between $T_m M \oplus \alg g$ and $A_m$, so the result follows since $\{\pder{x^1}_m, \dots, \pder{x^m}_m, E_1, \dots, E_m\}$ is a basis of $T_m M \oplus \alg g$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Let $U$ be a trivializing neighborhood of $A$ that also trivializes $M$. The map
\begin{eqnsplit}
\cdot_{loc} : (\Omega^\bullet_U(A), \wedge, \hat d_A) &\to (\Omega^\bullet(TU \oplus (U \times \alg g)), \wedge, \hat d_{TU \times \alg g})
\end{eqnsplit}
is an isomorphism of differential graded algebras. In particular
\begin{equation}
    (\hat d_A \omega)_{loc} = \hat d_{TU \times \alg g} \omega_{loc}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
They are isomorphic as $C^\infty(U)$-modules for each $\Omega^p_U$: easy

They are isomorphic as $\bb K$-algebras: easy

The differential ``commutes'' with loc: using the ``Koszul'' formula for the differential, it is necessary to use both that $S$ respects the anchor and the Lie bracket, i.e. \textbf{that $S$ is a Lie algebroid morphism}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Let $U$ be a trivializing neighborhood of $A$. The map
\begin{eqnsplit}
\cdot_{loc} : (\Omega^\bullet_U(A, L), \wedge, \hat d) &\to (\Omega^\bullet(TU \oplus (U \times \alg g), U \times \alg g), \wedge, \hat d_{TLA})
\end{eqnsplit}
is an isomorphism of differential graded algebras. In particular
\begin{equation}
    (\hat d \omega)_{loc} = \hat d_{TLA} \omega_{loc}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof is identical to that of the previous theorem, except for the last part. To see that the differential commutes it is neceessary to show that the induced representation of $TLA$ on $U \times \alg g$ via $ad: A|_U \to D_{Der}(U \times \alg g)$ is the $ad$ representation. This will follow from the fact that $\tilde psi$ respects the Lie bracket, i.e. $\psi$ is a trivialization of a LAB.
\end{proof}

Let $\omega \in \Omega^q(A, L)$ and let $\{\sectoid X_k\} \subset \Gamma(A)$ for $k = 1, \dots, q$. Let each $\sectoid X_k$ have a family of trivializations $\{\sect X_k \oplus \stilde \eta_k^i \in \Gamma(TU_i) \oplus C^\infty(U_i, \alg g)\}$, then, in $U_{ij} = U_i \inter U_j \neq \empty$
\begin{align*}
    \omega^i_{loc}(X_1 \oplus \stilde \eta_1^i, \cdots, X_q \oplus \stilde \eta_q^i) = \alpha^i_j \circ \omega^j_{loc}(X_1 \oplus \stilde \eta_1^j, \cdots, X_q \oplus \stilde \eta_q^j)

\begin{align}
    \omega^i_{loc} = \alpha^i_j \circ \omega^j_{loc} \circ s^j_i

$\alpha^i_j: \Omega^q_{TLA}(U_{ij}, \alg g) \to \Omega^q_{TLA}(U_{ij}, \alg g)$ and $\alpha^i_j: \Omega^q(TU_{ij}\times \alg g) \to \Omega^q(TU_{ij}\times \alg g)$ are isomorphisms of differential graded algebras.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Recall that, since a differential $d$ in a differential algebra is a local operator, $(d\omega)|_U = d|_U \omega|_U$; we will omit the $|_U$ besides the differentials for ease of reading.

We only show the result for the first $\hat \alpha^i_j$ map, since the other one follows from an identical calculation.

The interesting part is the commutation of $\hat \alpha^i_j$ with the differential, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
    \hat d_{TLA} \hat \alpha^i_j(\omega^j_{loc}|_{U_{ij}}) = \hat \alpha^i_j(\hat d_{TLA} (\omega^i_{loc}|_{U_{ij}})),
\end{equation*} which follows from the following calculation:
\begin{align*}
    \hat d_{TLA} \hat \alpha^i_j(\omega^j_{loc}|_{U_{ij}})
    &= \hat d_{TLA} (\omega^i_{loc}|_{U_{ij}}) \\
    &= (\hat d \omega)^i_{loc}|_{U_{ij}} & \text{since $\cdot_{loc}$ is isomorphism of differential algebras}\\
    &= \hat \alpha^i_j((\hat d \omega)^j_{loc}|_{U_{ij}}) \\
    &= \hat \alpha^i_j(\hat d_{TLA} (\omega^j_{loc}|_{U_{ij}})).
