Fernandes remarks that it is thanks to the Lie braket that it is possible to make this kind of Cartan calculi.

Why is it necessary? What does this mean? What does it allow?

What is the difference, if any, with connection theory?

Relation between exterior derivative and usual covariant derivative:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Finer than $d$: requiring $TM$ necessarily, because it is based on a connection $TM \to \mathcal D(E)$
    
    \item Coarser than $d$: does not require a representation, a connection doesn't have to be a homomorphism of Lie algebras.
        
    \end{itemize}

Vector calculus.

TODO\todo{check this}: the third ``important example'' introduced in Lazzarini is important to me? $A$ connections on $E$ are used to define finite gauge transformations, which somehow induce the infinitesimal gauge transformation definition on generalized connections?

\item Respect further structure... of $L$?

\item Differential algebras? Differential calculi $(\Omega, d)$?

\section{Trivial Lie Algebroid}

To understand better:
\begin{itemize}
    
\item $(\Omega(A), \hat d_A)$ as $(\Omega(M)\otimes \bigwedge g^*, d + s)$.

\item $(\Omega(A, L), \hat d)$ as $(\Omega(M)\otimes \bigwedge g^* \otimes \mathfrak g, d + s')$ : \[(\Omega_{TLA}(M, \mathfrak g), \hat d_{TLA})\]

\item Generic element in $\Omega^n$, given dual basis $\theta = \set{\theta^a}$ of a basis of $\alg g$ $\set{E_a}$
\begin{align*}
    \omega = \sum_{p + s = n} \omega^\theta_{\mu_1 \cdots a_1 \cdots a_s} dx^{\mu_1} wedge \cdots \theta^{a_s}
\end{align*}

\section{Local Description of (real and $L$ valued) forms on Transitive Lie Algebroids}

\begin{itemize}
    
\item Local trivialization of a form $\omega \mapsto \omega_{loc}$

\item $d_{TLA}\omega_{loc} = (d \omega)_{loc}$

\item $\hat \alpha^i_j$ for both real and $L$ valued forms.

\item Respects $d$. So $\hat \alpha$ is isomorphism of differential graded algebras.

\item $G^i_j$, matrix representation of $\hat \alpha^i_j$. Real valued, and $L$-valued:
    \begin{align}
        \omega^i_{\mu_1 \cdots a_1 \cdots a_s} &= G\cdots G \alpha^i_j(\omega^j_{\mu_1 \cdots b_1}) \\
        \omega^i_{\mu_1 \cdots a_1 \cdots a_s} &= G\cdots G \omega^j_{\mu_1 \cdots b_1}
    \end{align}

\item For Atiyah... for example, how does $G$ look. $\omega^i_{loc} = s_i^* \hat \omega$

\section{Atiyah Lie Algebroid alternative Description?}

There seem to be $2$, related, alternative descriptions (Lazzarini2012):
    
    \begin{itemize}
        
    \item $(\Omega(A, L), \hat d)$ a $(\Omega_{TLA}(P, \mathfrak g)_{equ}, \hat d_{TLA})$,
    
    \item and $(R, Ad)$-equivariant forms in $(\Omega(P) \times \mathfrak g, d)$. Denoted by: \[ (\Omega_{Lie}(P, \mathfrak g), \hat d) \]
        
    \end{itemize}
