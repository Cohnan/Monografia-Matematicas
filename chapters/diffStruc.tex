Fernandes remarks that it is thanks to the Lie braket that it is possible to make this kind of Cartan calculi.

Why is it necessary? What does this mean? What does it allow?

What is the difference, if any, with connection theory?

Relation between exterior derivative and usual covariant derivative:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Finer than $d$: requiring $TM$ necessarily, because it is based on a connection $TM \to \mathcal D(E)$
    
    \item Coarser than $d$: does not require a representation, a connection doesn't have to be a homomorphism of Lie algebras.
        
    \end{itemize}

Why relevant to me:
    \begin{itemize}
        
    \item Vector calculus?
    
    \item What can be integrated. Inner integration generates usual (vector bundle valued) forms on the base manifold.
    
    \item Algebroid connections are ``normalized'' elements $ \omega \in \Omega^1(A, L)$, and their curvature is $d\omega \in \Omega^2(A, L)$. Generalized connections are precisely the elements of $\Omega^1(A, L)$.
    
    \item When talking about matter fields, a generalized connection $\hat \omega$ induces covariant derivatives $\hat \nabla^E: \Gamma(E) \to \mathbf{\Omega^1(A, E)}$, so that $\hat \nabla^E \phi \in \Omega^1(A, E)$.
    
    \item $\Omega^\bullet(A)$ is used to do cohomology on Lie algebroids
    
    \item In each $\Omega^p(A, L)$ the natural scalar product $(\omega, \eta) = \cl{\omega, \star \eta} = \int_A h(\omega, \star \eta)$, for $h$ in inner metric, is what will be used to define the gauge action:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            
        \item For $\hat \omega \in \Omega^1(A, L)$, define $S_{Gauge}[\hat \omega] = (\hat R, \hat R)$
        
        \item For $\phi \in \Gamma(E)$ and $\hat \omega$ as above, $S_{Matter}[\phi, \hat \omega] := (\hat \nabla^E \phi, \hat \nabla^E \phi)$
        
        \end{itemize}
        
    \end{itemize}

TODO\todo{check this}: the third ``important example'' introduced in Lazzarini is important to me? $A$ connections on $E$ are used to define finite gauge transformations, which somehow induce the infinitesimal gauge transformation definition on generalized connections? If not for this, $A$-connections, and so this examples, are of no relevance to me.

\subsection{Differential Algebras}

\begin{itemize}

\item Alt

\item $\Omega$

\item $d$. Is antiderivation

\item $(\Omega, d)$ Graded differential algebras. Differential calculus (over a commutative algebra?) ?
    
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item $(\Omega(A), \hat d_A)$ is graded commutative differential algebra
    
    \item $(\Omega(A, L), \hat d)$ is graded differential Lie algebra.
    
    \end{itemize}

\item Respect further structure... of $L$?

\end{itemize}

\linea 

Throughout this section, let $A$ be a Lie algebroid over the manifold $M$ with anchor $a$.

\begin{definition}
Let $E$ be a vector bundle over $M$. 

    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Let \emph{$\Alt^0(A, E)$}$:= E$.
    
    \item For $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 1}$, let \emph{$\Alt^n(A, E)$} be the natural embedding, as alternating maps, of the hom-bundle $\Hom(\bigwedge^n A, E)$ into the vector bundle of $\Hom^n(A, E)$ over $M$. Its fiber at $m \in M$ is the vector space of alternating linear transformations $\{\omega: \underbrace{A_m \times \cdots \times A_m}_{\text{$n$ times}} \to E_m \st \text{$\omega$ is $\RR$-linear and alternating}\}$.
    
    \item Let \emph{$\Alt^\bullet(A, E)$}$:= \bigoplus^\infty_{n = 0} \Alt^n(A, E)$.
    % OJO: i can't call this forms, since forms are either C^\infty M multilinear, or complete vector bundle morphisms!
    
    %\item For $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$, let \emph{$\Alt^n(A)$} and \emph{$Alt^\bullet (A)$} be the application of the previous definitions to the trivial vector bundle $E = M \times \RR$.
        
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{definition}

Notice that $\Alt^\bullet(A, E)$ is a vector bundle with finite dimensional fibers since, due to the antisymmetry property, $\Alt^n(A, E) = 0$ for all values of $n$ greater than some fixed value $N \in \ZZ > 0$.

\begin{definition}
Let $E$ be a vector bundle over $M$ on which there is a representation $\phi: A \to \alg D(E)$ of $A$.

    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item For $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$, define the $C^\infty(M)$-module \emph{$\Omega^n(A, E)$}$:= \Gamma\Alt^n(A, E)$. Its elements are called \emph{$E$-valued $n$-forms on $A$}.
    
    \item Define the $C^\infty(M)$-module $\emph{\Omega^\bullet(A, E)} := \bigoplus^\infty_{n = 0} \Omega^n(A, E)$. Its elements are simply called \emph{$E$-valued forms on $A$}.
    
    %\item \item For $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$, let \emph{$\Omega^n(A)$}$:= \Gamma\Alt^n(A)$. 
    
    %\item Define the $C^\infty(M)$-module $\emph{\Omega^\bullet(A)} := \bigoplus^\infty_{n = 0} \Omega^n(A)$.
        
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Due to the bijective correspondence between $C^\infty(M)$-linear maps between sections of vector bundles and vector bundle morphisms, $\Omega^n(A, E)$ may be considered the space of $C^\infty(M)$-multilinear antisymmetric maps from $\Gamma(A)^n$ to $\Gamma(E) = \Omega^0(A, E)$. We will refer as \ptext{$E$-valued $n$-forms on $A$} to both elements
\begin{align}
    \omega &: \underbrace{A \oplus \cdots \oplus A}_{\text{$n$ times}} \to E & \text{alternating $\RR$-vector bundle morphism}\\
    \omega &: \underbrace{\Gamma(A) \times \cdots \times \Gamma(A)}_{\text{$n$ times}} \to \Gamma(E) & \text{alternating $C^\infty(M)$-multilinear map}.
\end{align}
    
    %\item $\Omega^n(A)$ may be considered the space of $C^\infty(M)$-multilinear antisymmetric maps from $\Gamma(A)^n$ to $C^\infty(M)$.
    
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item $\Alt^n(A, E)$ and $E \otimes \bigwedge^n A^*$ are isomorphic vector bundles.
    
    %\item $\Alt^n(A)$ and $\bigwedge^n A^*$ are isomorphic vector bundles.
    
    \item $\Omega^n(A, E)$ and $\Gamma(E) \otimes \Gamma\Alt^n A^*$ are isomorphic $C^\infty(M)$-modules.
    
    %\item $\Omega^n(A)$ and $\Gamma\Alt^nA^*$ are isomorphic $C^\infty(M)$-modules.
    
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
$\Alt^n(A, E) \cong \Hom(\bigwedge^n A, E)$ by definition, and $\Hom(\bigwedge^n A, E) \cong E \otimes (\bigwedge^n A)* \cong E \otimes \bigwedge^n A*$.

Since $\Gamma$ is a strong monoidal function\todo{can I make this more clear?}, it distributes over the tensor product, and so the result follows from the first part of the theorem.
\end{proof}

% Only define things for A, E, and THEN do define the one without E
\begin{definition}
Let $E$ be a Lie algebra bundle over $M$ on which $A$ is represented. Define on $\Omega^\bullet(A, E)$ the binary operation, called \emph{the wedge product of LAB-valued forms on $A$}
\begin{eqnsplit}
\wedge : \Omega^p(A, E) \times \Omega^q(A, E) &\to \Omega^{p+q}(A, E) \\
(\omega \wedge \eta)(\sectoid X_1, \dots, \sectoid X_{p+q}) &:= \\
\frac{1}{p!q!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_{p+q}} &(-1)^{\sigma} [\omega(\oid X_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, \oid X_{\sigma(p)}), \eta(\oid X_{\sigma(p+1)}, \cdots, \oid X_{\sigma(p+q)})].
\end{eqnsplit}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $E$ be a LAB over $M$ on which there is a representation $\phi: A \to \alg D(E)$ of $A$. Define the differential $\hat d_\phi: \Omega^{\bullet}(A, E) \to \Omega^{\bullet+1}(A, E)$ by the Koszul formula
\begin{align}
\hat d_\phi
\end{align}


\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $E$ be a LAB over $M$ on which there is a representation $\phi: A \to \alg D(E)$ of $A$. Then $(\Omega^\bullet(A, E), \wedge, \hat d_\phi)$ is a graded differential (Lie?) algebra.
\end{theorem}

\section{Trivial Lie Algebroid}

To understand better:
\begin{itemize}
    
\item $(\Omega(A), \hat d_A)$ as $(\Omega(M)\otimes \bigwedge g^*, d + s)$.

\item $(\Omega(A, L), \hat d)$ as $(\Omega(M)\otimes \bigwedge g^* \otimes \mathfrak g, d + s')$ : \[(\Omega_{TLA}(M, \mathfrak g), \hat d_{TLA})\]

\item Generic element in $\Omega^n$, given dual basis $\theta = \set{\theta^a}$ of a basis of $\alg g$ $\set{E_a}$
\begin{align*}
    \omega = \sum_{p + s = n} \omega^\theta_{\mu_1 \cdots a_1 \cdots a_s} dx^{\mu_1} wedge \cdots \theta^{a_s}
\end{align*}

\section{Local Description of (real and $L$ valued) forms on Transitive Lie Algebroids}

\begin{itemize}
    
\item Local trivialization of a form $\omega \mapsto \omega_{loc}$

\item $d_{TLA}\omega_{loc} = (d \omega)_{loc}$

\item $\hat \alpha^i_j$ for both real and $L$ valued forms.

\item Respects $d$. So $\hat \alpha$ is isomorphism of differential graded algebras.

\item $G^i_j$, matrix representation of $\hat \alpha^i_j$. Real valued, and $L$-valued:
    \begin{align}
        \omega^i_{\mu_1 \cdots a_1 \cdots a_s} &= G\cdots G \alpha^i_j(\omega^j_{\mu_1 \cdots b_1}) \\
        \omega^i_{\mu_1 \cdots a_1 \cdots a_s} &= G\cdots G \omega^j_{\mu_1 \cdots b_1}
    \end{align}

\item For Atiyah... for example, how does $G$ look. $\omega^i_{loc} = s_i^* \hat \omega$

\section{Atiyah Lie Algebroid alternative Description?}

There seem to be $2$, related, alternative descriptions (Lazzarini2012):
    
    \begin{itemize}
        
    \item $(\Omega(A, L), \hat d)$ a $(\Omega_{TLA}(P, \mathfrak g)_{equ}, \hat d_{TLA})$,
    
    \item and $(R, Ad)$-equivariant forms in $(\Omega(P) \times \mathfrak g, d)$. Denoted by: \[ (\Omega_{Lie}(P, \mathfrak g), \hat d) \]
        
    \end{itemize}
