INTRODUCTION \complete{ Hacer la introducción. Quizá ver pequeños comentrios de Mackenzie y de Lazzarini} In \ref{chp:intro} we saw how the basic elements in a gauge theory are a principal bundle, encoding the 


Throughout this section, $M$ will be a smooth manifold.

\section{Basic Definitions}

\begin{definition} [Lie Algebroid over $M$]\label{defnLieAlgoid}
A \emph{Lie algebroid over $M$} is a triple $(q:A \to M, a, [\cdot, \cdot ])$, where $q:A \to M$ is a vector bundle, 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $a:A \to TM$ is a vector bundle morphism called \emph{the anchor of $A$}, and
    \item \emph{the bracket of $A$} $[\cdot, \cdot ]: \Gamma(A) \times \Gamma(A) \to \Gamma(A)$ is a Lie algebra structure on the $\RR$-vector space $\Gamma(A)$ (an $\RR$-bilinear alternating map) \info{The bracket doesn't need to exist fiberwwise as a metric. e.g. the bracket of vector fields doesn't}
    \end{itemize}  which satisfy the following compatibility conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The map induced by $a$ on the sections, which we call by the same name, $a:\Gamma(A) \to \Gamma(TM)$ is a \emph{Lie algebra morphism}, that is, for any $\oid X, \oid Y \in \Gamma(A)$ \[ a([\oid X, \oid Y])  = [a(\oid X), a(\oid Y)] \in  \Gamma(TM)\]
    
    \item (Leibniz identity) For any $\oid X, \oid Y \in \Gamma(A)$, $f \in C^\infty (M)$: \[ [\oid X, f\oid Y] = f[\oid X, \oid Y] + a(\oid X)(f)\, \oid Y \] where $a(\oid X)(f)$ means the usual derivative of an element of a function on $M$ in the direction of $a(\oid X) \in \Gamma(TM)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

As it is usual, to simplify notation we will often say instead that \emph{$A$ is a Lie algebroid over the manifold $M$ with anchor $a$}, and the brackets will be denoted simply by $[,]$ for all Lie algebroids.

Recall that, when talking about $C^r-$differentiable vector fields, a vector-bundle chart, or simply a chart, will make reference to a local trivialization $\psi: U \times V \to E|_U$ which is $C^r$-differentiable.


\begin{proposition}
$\Gamma A$ is a finite projective module over $M$. Furthermore, the map $a: \Gamma(A) \to \Gamma(TM)$ is $C^\infty(M)$-linear.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It is $C^\infty(M)$ module:
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

The previous result remarks the algebraic perspective which may also be used to study this topic, in contrast to the topological perspective that has been adopted in this document. However, this perspective is sometimes useful and will be used whenever clarity may be gained by its use.

\ptext{For the rest of the chapter $A$ will refer to a Lie algebroid over a manifold $M$ with anchor $a$, unless otherwise stated.}

\begin{definition} [(Base preserving) morphism of Lie algebroids] 
Given two algebroids over the manifold $M$, $A$ with anchor $a$ and $A'$ with anchor $a'$, \emph{a base preserving Lie algebroid morphism} $\phi: A \to A'$ is a vector bundle morphism such that $a' \comp \phi = a $, and such that $\phi[\oid X, \oid Y] = [\phi(\oid X), \phi(\oid Y)]$ for all $\oid X, \oid Y \in \Gamma(A)$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} [Extension of Lie algebroids over $M$]
Let $A, A', A''$ be Lie algebroids over $M$. \emph{An extension of Lie algebroids over $M$} is a sequence of Lie algebroids over $M$ \[ 0 \to A' \to A \to A'' \to 0 \] which is exact as sequence of vector bundles over $M$.
\end{definition}

\rule{10cm}{1mm}

\begin{definition}[Direct sum of Lie algebroids]
Let $A, A'$ be Lie algebroids over $M$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Given an open subset $U$ of $M$, and given $\oid X, \oid Y : M \to A$ sections of the vector bundle $A$, the restriction to $U$ of $[\oid X, \oid Y] \in \Gamma(A)$ depends only on the restrictions of $\oid X$ and $\oid Y$ to $U$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

The previous result allows us to restrict the Lie bracket of $A$ to the restriction vector bundle of $A$ to $U$, $A_U$.

\begin{definition}
Let $(q:A \to M, a: A \to M, [,]:\Gamma(A)\times \Gamma(A) \to \Gamma(A))$ be a Lie algebroid. The restriction of the Lie algebroid $A$ to $U \subset M$, is the restriction vector bundle $A$ to $U$ $A_U$ with projection map $q_U: A_U \to U$, together with the anchor $a_U:A_U \to TU$ and bracket $[,]:\Gamma(A_U)\times \Gamma(A_U) \to \Gamma(A_U)$ that result from the restrictions to $U$ of the anchor and bracket of $A$.

\section{Examples}

\subsection{The Tangent Bundle}

The tangent bundle of a manifold $M$ is the most basic example of a Lie algebroid, as it should be if we want to understand Lie algebroids on $M$ as generalized directions on $M$.

For any manifold $M$, its tangent bundle $TM$ with its projection $\pi:TM \to M$ and the vector field commutator $[,]: \Gamma(TM)\times \Gamma(TM) \to \Gamma(TM)$ as bracket, together with the identity of $TM$ as anchor make $TM$ a Lie algebroid over $M$.

We will denote by capital letters near the end of the alphabet like $X, Y$ to refer both to elements of $TM$ and of $\Gamma(TM)$, and $X_m$ if we want to emphasize that it is in the fiber of $m \in M$\complete{Come up with a way to refer to sections that differs from element of TM, or perhaps but mentioning it as notation}

\subsubsection{Explicit Examples}

The following are manifolds and their tangent bundles which we will use regularly.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\RR^n$. Its tangent vectors may be expressed both as derivatives of paths, or simply as vectors that are associated to a specific fiber.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item $\CC^2$
        \item $\HH^2$
        \end{itemize}
    \item $S^1$. Its tangent vectors are:
    \item $S^2$. Some of its tangent vectors are: . A set of basis vectors is...
    \item $S^3$ / $\HH^*$. Some of its tangent vectors are: . A set of basis vectors is...
    \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Pullback of Regular submanifolds}

Another example that shows the arising of Lie algebroids is when we restrict $TM$ to the regular submanifold $N$, in which case we not only have the tangent directions to $N$, but also some additional ``perpendicular'' directions.

Let $N$ topological subspace of $M$ be a regular submanifold of $M$ (i.e. $N$ may be described locally by the vanishing of some of the coordinates of a chart of $M$; alternatively, the inclusion $N \to M$ is an immersion). Let $T\bar N = \pi^{-1} M$; it is easy to see\complete{I believe that in Mackenzie 2.1 or 2.2 something about pullbacks is said, perhaps allowing me to prove that this is true} that this vector bundle is homeomorphic to the pullback of $TM$ under the inclusion of $N$ in $M$. Let anchor $a = i^*\pi: T \bar N \to TN$ 

Again using a compatible adapted atlas of $M$ relative to $N$, we may prove that 
\begin{itemize}
\item The vector bundle $TN$ is embedded in $T \bar N$
\item The bracket of $TM$ restricts correctly to $T \bar N$
\item See that $T \bar N = TN \oplus T^\perp N$
\item See that $a(T^\perp N) = 0$.
\end{itemize}
 
AAaaah, tal vez no puedo pegar los [X, Y] locales para hacer una seccion de $T \bar N$... por otro lado está la cuestión de si puedo extender cualquier sección $T \bar N$ a una seccion de $TM$... estas 2 cosas no me permiten ver si en efecto $T \bar N$ es algebroide de Lie \todo{Can I see that the local definition of the commutator transforms as a vector field?}

Si este ejemplo funciona, is it always the sum of the tangent bundle and the ``normal bundle''?\todo{What is the normal bundle?} That is ``obvious'' in local coordinates.




Explicit examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $N = \RR^2$ as a regular submanifold $\RR^3$, seen as the hyperplane $z = 0$, our Lie algebroid $T \bar {\RR^2}$ not only contains the span of $\partial_x$ and $\partial_y$, but also allows vectors with perpendicular components: in the direction of $\partial_y$. We may see this Lie algebroid as the direct sum of $T \RR^2$ with 
\item If $N = S^2$ as a regular submanifold of $\RR^3$, using spherical coordinates we see that $T \bar {S^2}$ is not only $TS^2 = span\set{\partial_\theta, \partial_\phi}$, but also $T^\perp S^2 = span\set{\partial_r}$ 
\item Let $N = \RR^2$ seen as the regular submanifold of $\RR^n$ determined by $x_3 = x_4 = \dots = 0$. In this case the original tangent direction to $N$ are spanned by $\partial_1, \partial_2$, but we have $n-2$ additional directions, all of which have $0$ as their anchor or horizontal component.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Involutive Distributions/Foliations}

In the previous example we saw a family of examples of Lie algebroids which contained directions additional to the tangent directions of the manifold. However, the opposite may also occur.

\begin{definition} {Foliation of $M$}
Let $\mathcal F = \set{L_\alpha}_{\alpha \in A}$ for some indexing set $A$ be a collection of disjoint connected regular submanifolds of $M$ whose union is all of $M$. $\mathcal F$ is called \emph{a $p$-dimensional (smooth) foliation of $M$} if every $m \in M$ is an element of a chart\todo{does it have to be a chart?}  $(U, \phi:U \to \RR^n)$ for which the coordinates of any $L_\alpha \in \mathcal F$ that intersects with $U$, $U \cap L_\alpha$ is described in the chart by the equations $x^{p+1} = c^{p+1}, \cdots , x^{n} = c^{n} $ for constants $c^{p+1}, \dots c^n \in \RR$. The elements $L_\alpha \in \mathcal F$ are called \emph{the leaves of the foliation $\mathcal F$}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Distribution on $M$}
\emph{An $q$-dimensional distribution on $M$} is a subbundle of $TM$ of rank $q$.
\end{definition}

Let $\mathcal F = \set{L_\alpha}_{\alpha \in A}$ be a $p$-dimensional foliation of $M$. Each leaf is a regular submanifold of $M$, therefore $T L_\alpha$ is embedded in $TM$, so we see $T L_\alpha$ as a submanifold \todo{is it?} of $TM$, and so the disjoint union $E = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} T L_\alpha$ is also a submanifold of $TM$. Additionally, we see that $E$ has vector bundle structure over $M$ of rank $p$, because each $m \in M$ is an element of a unique leaf $L$ and $T_m L \subset E$ is a vector space of dimension $p$; TL can be given a nice atlas?

Integrable distribution

The converse is called Frobenius theorem:

Explicit examples:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Foliation in integral lines iff 1 dimensional distribution
    \item Second class? First class?
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Trivial Lie Algebroid}

The trivial Lie algebroid makes explicit the understanding of Lie algebroids as spaces of generalized tangent directions for their base manifolds, as it is simply the combination of both the usual tangent directions of the manifold, together with Lie algebra directions added by hand. This understanding of Lie algebroids is further supported by the fact, proven in \ref{}, that any transitive Lie algebroid has this form locally. The transitive part, as we will see, simply means that the anchor/shadow map for each $m \in M$ covers all vectors tangent to $x$, so the interpretation of Lie algebroids doesn't lose force by this additional requirement, as it may very well be that the Lie algebroid doesn't cover all directions tangent to $x$, but only some.

Compatibility map

Let $M$ be a manifold, and $\algeb g$ a (real) Lie algebra with Lie bracket $[,]: \algeb g \times \algeb g$. 

Consider $p_1: M \times \algeb g \to M$, $(m, \eta) \mapsto m$ as the trivial vector bundle with fiber $\algeb g$ and base $M$. To refer to an element of this bundle we will usually use greek letters like $\eta, \theta, \kappa, \dots$, and to emphasize that such an element belongs to the fiber of $m \in M$ we will use subscripts, so $\eta_m \in M \times \algeb g$ is such that $p_1(\eta_m) = m$; . A section of this bundle will be denoted by capital greek letters like $H, \Theta, K, \dots$ and their image in the fiber of $m \in M$ will once again be denoted by the subscript $m$, so $H \in \Gamma(M \times \algeb g)$ and $H_m \in p_1^{-1}(m)$. $X(H)$, $H$ corresponds canonically to a function $M \to g$. (The sections of/This vector bundle) has a natural Lie structure given by the fiberwise Lie bracket of the Lie algebra $\algeb g$.

Now consider the internal direct sum over $M$ of the vector bundles $TM$ and $M \times \algeb g$; recall \unsure{Here I'm being explicit with basic stuff of vector bundle theory on purpose, but I'm not sure if this will stay} that the underlying set of this bundle is simply the subset of the cartesian product $TM \times (M \times \algeb g)$ given by $TM \oplus (M \times \algeb g) = \set{(X, \eta) \in TM \times (M \times \algeb g) \st \pi(X) = p_1(\eta)}$; we will call the projection of this vector bundle $\pi: X \oplus \eta \mapsto \pi(X) = p_1(\eta)$, abusing the notation; we write an element of this vector bundle as $X \oplus \eta$, where $X \in \pi^{-1}(m)$ and $\eta \in p_1^{-1}(m)$.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item The anchor is given by the projection $a: TM \times (M \times \algeb g) \to TM$, $X \oplus \eta \mapsto X$. This map is a vector bundle map as it clearly respects the fibers and, on the fiber over each $m\in M$ it restricts to  a projection map $a_x:T_x M \times (\set{m}\times \algeb g)$ of vector spaces, which is a linear map.
    
    \item The bracket is given by 
    \[
        [X \oplus H, Y \oplus \Theta] = [X, Y] \oplus \{X(\Theta) - Y(H) + [H, \Theta]\}
    \]
    for all $X, Y \in \Gamma(TM)$, $H, Y \in \Gamma(M \times \algeb g)$. Notice that in the above formula the symbols $[,]$ are used in $3$ different instances, each one referring to the brackets of $3$ different spaces. $X(\Theta)$ makes reference to the derivative in direction of $X$ of the vector valued function $M \to \algeb g$ associated to $\Theta$, or, simply, to the Lie derivative of the section $\Theta \in \Gamma(M \times \algeb g)$, $\mathcal L_X \Theta$. Veamos que esto es una estructura de Lie en $\Gamma(TM \times (M \times \algeb g))$:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Alternating:
        \item Leibniz:
        \item Jacobi:
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

Let's check that the compatibility conditions between the anchor and the bracket are satisfied; let $X \oplus H, Y \oplus \Theta \in \Gamma(TM \oplus (M \times \algeb g))$, $f \in C^\infty(M)$:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item $a([X \oplus H, Y \oplus \Theta]) = a(\, [X, Y] \oplus \{X(\Theta) - Y(H) + [H, \Theta] \,) = [X, Y] = [a(X \oplus H), a(Y \oplus \Theta)]$
    
    \item 
    \begin{align*}
        [X \oplus H, &f\cdot (Y \oplus \Theta)] =\\
        &= [X \oplus H, fY \oplus f\Theta] \\
        &=  [X, fY] \oplus \{X(f\Theta) - fY(H) + [H, f\Theta]\} \\
        &= (f[X, Y] + X(f)\,Y) \oplus \{X(f)\,\Theta + f\,X(\Theta) - fY(H) + f[H, \Theta]\} \\
        &=f([X, Y] \oplus \{ X(\Theta) -Y(H) + [H, \Theta]\} ) + (X(f) Y \oplus X(f)\Theta) \\
        &= f[X \oplus H, Y \oplus \Theta] + a(X \oplus H)f \, (Y \oplus \Theta)
    \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}

The vector bundle $TM \times (M \times \algeb g)$ together with the previously defined anchor and bracket is called \emph{the trivial Lie algebroid on $M$ with structure algebra $\algeb g$}.

\subsection{The Atiyah Lie Algebroid of a Principal Bundle}

Can be viewed as G-invariant P->g functions, TP 

Makes reasonable undrestanding of Lie algebroids as sets of directions that are consistent with the shadow (TM) directions

In \ref{} we motivated the use of $TP/G$ as a natural place to talk about connections of $P$, and why that was important, and we also claimed in \ref{} that it was a vector bundle over $M$, that it inherited a well defined bracket, and that the quotient map of the pushforward of the projection was vector bundle morphism into $TM$.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Alternative 1: 
        \item $TP$ is a vector bundle over $P$, $G$ acts to the right. (+ $G$ acts by v.b. isomorphism + $TP$ is covered by equivariant charts i.e. the action of $g$ doesn't affect the vector in which $p$ or $pg$ correspond). By proposition 3.1.1. of Mackenzie 
            \begin{itemize}
            \item $TP/G$ is a vector bundle over $M$,
            %\item the projection $TP \to TP/G$ is a surjective bundle morphism (and submersion)
            %\item and $TP$ is a pullback of $TP/G$ by the projection $\pi:P \to M$
            \end{itemize}  
        \item The bracket is well defined
    \item Alternative 2:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item $TP/G \to M$ is a ($C^\infty(M)$) vector bundle over $M$ (3.1.1 gives a more general procedure for this)
        \item Anchor: easy
        \item $\Gamma(TP/G)$ has a Lie bracket. Steps:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item $C^\infty(M)$-module isomorphic to $\Gamma_G(TP)$
            \item $[\oid X, \oid Y]$ for $\oid X, \oid Y \in \Gamma_G(TP)$ is also in $\Gamma_G(TP)$
            \item Has Lie bracket: should be easy: pullback of the Lie bracket of the isomorphism
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item Compatibility Cond 1: Not sure. Perhaps using, for $f \in C^\infty(M)$ the corresponding $\tilde f \in C_G^\infty(P)$ (the smoothness can be shown easily with for every local trivialization using the smoothness of $f$)
        
        \item Compatibility COnd. 2: Not sure, but it should end up proving that $\oid X (\tilde f) = \Tilde{X(f)}$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}


Now we check the compatibility conditions:

Alternative 3:%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

What is necessary:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $E/G$ is a smooth manifold
    \item The chosen charts are also local trivializations that make $E/G$ a vector bundle.
    \item $\natural$ is a surjective submersion -> to prove 3.1.2
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Trivial Principal Bundle and its Atiyah Lie Algebroid}

The main purpose of the next propositions is to allow us to give a smooth structure to $TP/G$, to show that certain important maps are also smooth, and to understand the brackets that will arise for $\Gamma(TP/G)$, among other things related to the adjoint bundle $P\times \algeb g/G$.

\begin{proposition}
Let $E$ be a (smooth) vector bundle over $P$ with projection map $p^E: E \to P$. Suppose that $G$ acts (smoothly) to the right on $E$ in such a way that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each $g \in G$ acts by vector bundle isomorphism over the right translation map $R_g: P \to P$.
    
    \item $E$ is covered by $G$-equivariant $\pi$-saturated charts. That is, for each $p_0 \in P$ there is a chart of E $\psi: \mathcal U \times V \to E|_{\mathcal U}$, where $p_0 \in \mathcal U = \pi^{-1}(U)$ for some open $U \subset M$, that satisfies $\psi(p, v)g = \psi(pg, v)$ for all $p \in \mathcal U$, $v \in V$, $g \in G$.
\end{enumerate}

Then the quotient space $E/G$ has a (smooth) vector bundle structure over $M$ which is unique in the sense that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $E/G$ has the unique manifold structure that makes the quotient map $\natural: E \to E/G$ a surjective submersion.
    \item $E/G$ has the unique vector bundle structure that makes the quotient map $\natural$ linear over $\pi: P \to M$.
\end{itemize}

We will denote by $\langle \mu \rangle \in E/G$ the orbit of $\mu \in E$, and by $p:E/G \to M$ the projection map; this map satisfies $p \circ \natural = \pi \circ p^E$.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Notice that conditions (1) and (2) tell us that, locally, the exact point in the fiber $\pi^{-1}(x) \in P$ that we choose is not important to determine the vector space $V$ nor the representing vector $v \in V$, therefore it should make sense to mod out that redundancy, obtained by the group action, to make charts $U \times V \to E/G|_U$. This is what we will now formalize.

Let $p: E/G \to M$, $\langle \mu \rangle \mapsto \pi(p^E(\mu))$; this function is well defined because, by (1), $p^E(\mu g)$ and $p^E(\mu)$ are in the same fiber of $P$, for all $g \in G$. (Notice that condition (1) implies that $p^E(\mu g) = p^E(\mu) g$ for $\mu$ and $g$ arbitrary).

For $x \in M$, let $\psi: \mathcal U \times V \to E|_{\mathcal U}$, $x \in U$, be a chart of $E$ as in condition (2); we may further assume that $U$ is a trivializing neighborhood of $P$ (by intersecting one such neighborhood of $x$ with $U$ if necessary), so that there exists a local section of $\pi$, $\sigma: U \to \mathcal U \subset P$ such that the local trivialization of $P$ is described by $U\times G \to \mathcal U$, $(y, g) \mapsto \sigma(y)g$.

We'll now see that $E/G|_x$ may be given vector space structure, which turns out to be isomorphic to $V$. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, to define $\langle \mu \rangle + \langle \nu \rangle$ for $\langle \mu \rangle, \langle \nu \rangle \in E/G|_x$ arbitrary, let $g \in G$ be such that $p^E(\nu g) = p^E(\mu)$, which exists because of condition (1). This means that both $\mu$ and $\nu g$ belong to the same vector space $E_{p^E(\mu)}$, so we may define $\langle \mu \rangle + \langle \nu \rangle := \langle \mu + \nu g \rangle$. To see that this is well defined it suffices to show that the result doesn't change if another representative of, say, the class of $\langle \nu \rangle$ is chosen: let $\nu' \in \langle \nu \rangle$, thus there is element $g_\nu \in G$ such that $\nu = \nu' g_\nu$; now let $g' \in G$ be such that $p^E(\nu' g') = p^E(\mu)$, therefore $p^E(\nu g_\nu g') = p^E(\nu) g_\nu g' = p^E(\mu) \in P$ where the last equality follows from condition (1), which allows us to conclude that $g_\nu g' = g$ as $G$ acts 
\end{itemize}

Let 

\[
    \psi^{/G}: U \times V \to E/G|_{U}, (y, v) \mapsto \langle \psi(\sigma(y), v) \rangle
\]

Notice that this definition is independent of which local section is chosen, in the sense that if $\sigma'$ is another local section around $x \in M$, in the intersection of the domains of $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$, condition (2) implies that $\langle \psi(\sigma(y), v) \rangle  = \langle \psi(\sigma'(y), v) \rangle$.

\end{proof}

I hope to see that this motivates the Lie algebroid bracket.

\subsection{The Adjoint Bundle of a Principal Bundle}

Or more generally $B \times \algeb g / G$ for a bundle $B$ in which $G$ acts to the right.

The subfamily of examples we will be most interested in is the family of $P \times \algeb g/G$ where $P$ is a principal bundle over a manifold $M$ with structure (Lie) group $G$, whose Lie  algebra is $\algeb g$. This bundle may be thought of as follows: given a point $p \in P$, a lie group element $A$ may be thought of as an infinitesimal direction in which we may move from $p$, as $A$ is an infinitesimal group element which prompts an infinitesimal movement in $P$ by the group action\improvement{Improve: I think ``infinitesimal action'' is a standard thing. The infinitesimal word may need a revision or change.} We will also see that, furthermore, any vertifical infinitesimal direction of movement can be encoded by an element of $P \times \algeb g$. Additionally, we had seen in \ref{} how a connection form is equivalent to a  a v.b. map $TP/G \to P \times \algeb g/G$ which is a section of the inclusion map (we called this maps connection reforms). \dbbox{REWRITE NICELY ALL OF THIS, BUT INCORPORTATE IT}.


    \begin{itemize}
    \item $P \times \algeb g/G$ is a ($C^\infty(M)$) vector bundle over $M$ (The same 3.1.1. proposition that may be used to prove that $TP/G$ is so can be used to prove this)
    
    \item Anchor: $0$ anchor works trivially
    
    \item Lie Bracket: fiberwise structure: the fiberwise (over $P$) bracket of $P \times \algeb g$, and it is easily seen (at least in the matrix Lie algebras, although it shouldn't be difficult to prove that $ad$ commutes with $[,]$ which allows to prove this well definition for any Lie algebra)
    
    \item Compatibility 1: trivial
    
    \item Compatibility 2: trivial
    
    \item $P \times \algeb g/ G \to TP / G$ is a ($C\infty(M)$) vector bundle morphism over $M$ (this is also proved generally by proposition 3.1.2.). Furthermore:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item It is injective... It is a submersion?
        \item It respects the brackets on both sides
        \item Respects, trivially, the anchor.
        \item All of this allows us to see that $P \times \algeb g/G$ corresponds to the vertical infinitesimal directions.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item So we may regard $P \times \algeb g / G = ker a$, and not only as a vector bundle map, but, thanks to the respect for the anchor and, specially, the Lie bracket, we may regard $P \times \algeb g/G$ as a sub Lie algebroid of $TP/G$.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Representations}

This is a generalization of associated vector bundles of a principal bundle. In the bundle theory, sections of associated vector bundles are equivalent to $G$-equivariant functions $P \to V$, so $G$-invariant vector fields $\oid X \in \Gamma(P)$ are derivatives/derivations of this functions: $\Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(E)$ satisfying Leibniz for $G$-invariant functions of $P$ (equivalent to functions in $M$). FurtherIt is in representation lie algebroids where connections of this bundle induce covariant derivatives, just as principal bundle connections induce covariant derivatives in associated vector bundles.

\section{LABs and Transitive Lie Algebroids}

Definitions comming from Lie algebra theory semisimple, nilpotent, abelian, reductive.

If $A$ is regular, the image of the anchor defines a foliation of the base manifold, \emph{the characteristic foliation of $A$}, which is transitive over each leaf of the foliation.
