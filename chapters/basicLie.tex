INTRODUCTION \complete{ Hacer la introducción. Quizá ver pequeños comentrios de Mackenzie y de Lazzarini} In \ref{chp:intro} we saw how the basic elements in a gauge theory are a principal bundle, encoding the 


Throughout this section, $M$ will be a smooth manifold.

\section{Basic Definitions}

\begin{definition} [Lie Algebroid over $M$]\label{defnLieAlgoid}
A \emph{Lie algebroid over $M$} is a triple $(q:A \to M, a, [\cdot, \cdot ])$, where $q:A \to M$ is a vector bundle, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a:A \to TM$ is a vector bundle morphism called \emph{the anchor of $A$}, and
    \item \emph{the bracket of $A$} $[\cdot, \cdot ]: \Gamma(A) \times \Gamma(A) \to \Gamma(A)$ is a Lie algebra structure on the $\RR$-vector space $\Gamma(A)$ (an $\RR$-bilinear alternating map) \info{The bracket doesn't need to exist fiberwwise as a metric. e.g. the bracket of vector fields doesn't}
\end{itemize}  which satisfy the following compatibility conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The map induced by $a$ on the sections, which we call by the same name, $a:\Gamma(A) \to \Gamma(TM)$ is a \emph{Lie algebra morphism}, that is, for any $\oid X, \oid Y \in \Gamma(A)$ \[ a([\oid X, \oid Y])  = [a(\oid X), a(\oid Y)] \in  \Gamma(TM)\]
    
    \item (Leibniz identity) For any $\oid X, \oid Y \in \Gamma(A)$, $f \in C^\infty (M)$: \[ [\oid X, f\oid Y] = f[\oid X, \oid Y] + a(\oid X)(f)\, \oid Y \] where $a(\oid X)(f)$ means the usual derivative of an element of a function on $M$ in the direction of $a(\oid X) \in \Gamma(TM)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

As it is usual, to simplify notation we will often say instead that \emph{$A$ is a Lie algebroid over the manifold $M$ with anchor $a$}, and the brackets will be denoted simply by $[,]$ for all Lie algebroids.

\begin{proposition}
$\Gamma A$ is a finite projective module over $M$. Furthermore, the map $a: \Gamma(A) \to \Gamma(TM)$ is $C^\infty(M)$-linear.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is $C^\infty(M)$ module:
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

The previous result remarks the algebraic perspective which may also be used to study this topic, in contrast to the topological perspective that has been taken in this document. However, this perspective is sometimes useful and will be used whenever clarity may be gained by its use.

For the rest of the chapter $A$ will refer to a Lie algebroid over a manifold $M$ with anchor $a$, unless otherwise stated.

\begin{definition} [(Base preserving) morphism of Lie algebroids] 
Given two algebroids over the manifold $M$, $A$ with anchor $a$ and $A'$ with anchor $a'$, \emph{a base preserving Lie algebroid morphism} $\phi: A \to A'$ is a vector bundle morphism such that $a' \comp \phi = a $, and such that $\phi[\oid X, \oid Y] = [\phi(\oid X), \phi(\oid Y)]$ for all $\oid X, \oid Y \in \Gamma(A)$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} [Extension of Lie algebroids over $M$]
Let $A, A', A''$ be Lie algebroids over $M$. \emph{An extension of Lie algebroids over $M$} is a sequence of Lie algebroids over $M$ \[ 0 \to A' \to A \to A'' \to 0 \] which is exact as sequence of vector bundles over $M$.
\end{definition}

\rule{10cm}{1mm}

\begin{definition}[Direct sum of Lie algebroids]
Let $A, A'$ be Lie algebroids over $M$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Given an open subset $U$ of $M$, and given $\oid X, \oid Y : M \to A$ sections of the vector bundle $A$, the restriction to $U$ of $[\oid X, \oid Y] \in \Gamma(A)$ depends only on the restrictions of $\oid X$ and $\oid Y$ to $U$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

The previous result allows us to restrict the Lie bracket of $A$ to the restriction vector bundle of $A$ to $U$, $A_U$.

\begin{definition}
Let $(q:A \to M, a: A \to M, [,]:\Gamma(A)\times \Gamma(A) \to \Gamma(A))$ be a Lie algebroid. The restriction of the Lie algebroid $A$ to $U \subset M$, is the restriction vector bundle $A$ to $U$ $A_U$ with projection map $q_U: A_U \to U$, together with the anchor $a_U:A_U \to TU$ and bracket $[,]:\Gamma(A_U)\times \Gamma(A_U) \to \Gamma(A_U)$ that result from the restrictions to $U$ of the anchor and bracket of $A$.

\section{Examples}

\subsection{The Tangent Bundle}

For any manifold $M$, its tangent bundle $TM$ with its projection $\pi:TM \to M$ and the commutator $[,]: \Gamma(TM)\times \Gamma(TM) \to \Gamma(TM)$ as bracket, together with the identity of $TM$ as anchor make $TM$ a Lie algebroid over $M$.

\complete{Come up with a way to refer to sections that differs from element of TM, or perhaps but mentioning it as notation}

\subsubsection{Explicit Examples}

The following are manifolds and their tangent bundles which we will use regularly.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\RR^n$. Its tangent vectors may be expressed both as derivatives of paths, or simply as vectors that are associated to a specific fiber.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\CC^2$
        \item $\HH^2$
    \end{itemize}
    \item $S^1$. Its tangent vectors are:
    \item $S^2$. Some of its tangent vectors are: . A set of basis vectors is...
    \item $S^3$ / $\HH^*$. Some of its tangent vectors are: . A set of basis vectors is...

\subsection{The Atiyah Lie Algebroid of a Principal Bundle}

Can be viewed as G-invariant P->g functions, TP 

In \ref{} we motivated the use of $TP/G$ as a natural place to talk about connections of $P$, and why that was important, and we also claimed in \ref{} that it was a vector bundle over $M$, that it inherited a well defined bracket, and that the quotient map of the pushforward of the projection was vector bundle morphism into $TM$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alternative 1: 
        \item $TP$ is a vector bundle over $P$, $G$ acts to the right. (+ $G$ acts by v.b. isomorphism + $TP$ is covered by equivariant charts i.e. the action of $g$ doesn't affect the vector in which $p$ or $pg$ correspond). By proposition 3.1.1. of Mackenzie 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $TP/G$ is a vector bundle over $M$,
            %\item the projection $TP \to TP/G$ is a surjective bundle morphism (and submersion)
            %\item and $TP$ is a pullback of $TP/G$ by the projection $\pi:P \to M$
        \end{itemize}  
        \item The bracket is well defined
    \item Alternative 2:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $TP/G \to M$ is a ($C^\infty(M)$) vector bundle over $M$ (3.1.1 gives a more general procedure for this)
        \item Anchor: easy
        \item $\Gamma(TP/G)$ has a Lie bracket. Steps:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $C^\infty(M)$-module isomorphic to $\Gamma_G(TP)$
            \item $[\oid X, \oid Y]$ for $\oid X, \oid Y \in \Gamma_G(TP)$ is also in $\Gamma_G(TP)$
            \item Has Lie bracket: should be easy: pullback of the Lie bracket of the isomorphism
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Compatibility Cond 1: Not sure. Perhaps using, for $f \in C^\infty(M)$ the corresponding $\tilde f \in C_G^\infty(P)$ (the smoothness can be shown easily with for every local trivialization using the smoothness of $f$)
        
        \item Compatibility COnd. 2: Not sure, but it should end up proving that $\oid X (\tilde f) = \Tilde{X(f)}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


Now we check the compatibility conditions:

\subsubsection{Trivial Principal Bundle and its Atiyah Lie Algebroid}

I hope to see that this motivates the Lie algebroid bracket.

\subsubsection{Explicit Examples}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Trivial Lie Algebroid}

Compatibility map

Let $M$ be a manifold, and $\algeb g$ a (real) Lie algebra with Lie bracket $[,]: \algeb g \times \algeb g$. 

Consider $p_1: M \times \algeb g \to M$, $(m, \eta) \mapsto m$ as the trivial vector bundle with fiber $\algeb g$ and base $M$. To refer to an element of this bundle we will usually use greek letters like $\eta, \theta, \kappa, \dots$, and to emphasize that such an element belongs to the fiber of $m \in M$ we will use subscripts, so $\eta_m \in M \times \algeb g$ is such that $p_1(\eta_m) = m$; . A section of this bundle will be denoted by capital greek letters like $H, \Theta, K, \dots$ and their image in the fiber of $m \in M$ will once again be denoted by the subscript $m$, so $H \in \Gamma(M \times \algeb g)$ and $H_m \in p_1^{-1}(m)$. $X(H)$, $H$ corresponds canonically to a function $M \to g$. (The sections of/This vector bundle) has a natural Lie structure given by the fiberwise Lie bracket of the Lie algebra $\algeb g$.

Now consider the internal direct sum over $M$ of the vector bundles $TM$ and $M \times \algeb g$; recall \unsure{Here I'm being explicit with basic stuff of vector bundle theory on purpose, but I'm not sure if this will stay} that the underlying set of this bundle is simply the subset of the cartesian product $TM \times (M \times \algeb g)$ given by $TM \oplus (M \times \algeb g) = \set{(X, \eta) \in TM \times (M \times \algeb g) \st \pi(X) = p_1(\eta)}$; we will call the projection of this vector bundle $\pi: X \oplus \eta \mapsto \pi(X) = p_1(\eta)$, abusing the notation; we write an element of this vector bundle as $X \oplus \eta$, where $X \in \pi^{-1}(m)$ and $\eta \in p_1^{-1}(m)$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The anchor is given by the projection $a: TM \times (M \times \algeb g) \to TM$, $X \oplus \eta \mapsto X$. This map is a vector bundle map as it clearly respects the fibers and, on the fiber over each $m\in M$ it restricts to  a projection map $a_x:T_x M \times (\set{m}\times \algeb g)$ of vector spaces, which is a linear map.
    
    \item The bracket is given by 
    \[
        [X \oplus H, Y \oplus \Theta] = [X, Y] \oplus \{X(\Theta) - Y(H) + [H, \Theta]\}
    \]
    for all $X, Y \in \Gamma(TM)$, $H, Y \in \Gamma(M \times \algeb g)$. Notice that in the above formula the symbols $[,]$ are used in $3$ different instances, each one referring to the brackets of $3$ different spaces. $X(\Theta)$ makes reference to the derivative in direction of $X$ of the vector valued function $M \to \algeb g$ associated to $\Theta$, or, simply, to the Lie derivative of the section $\Theta \in \Gamma(M \times \algeb g)$, $\mathcal L_X \Theta$. Veamos que esto es una estructura de Lie en $\Gamma(TM \times (M \times \algeb g))$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alternating:
        \item Leibniz:
        \item Jacobi:
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Let's check that the compatibility conditions between the anchor and the bracket are satisfied; let $X \oplus H, Y \oplus \Theta \in \Gamma(TM \oplus (M \times \algeb g))$, $f \in C^\infty(M)$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $a([X \oplus H, Y \oplus \Theta]) = a(\, [X, Y] \oplus \{X(\Theta) - Y(H) + [H, \Theta] \,) = [X, Y] = [a(X \oplus H), a(Y \oplus \Theta)]$
    
    \item 
    \begin{align*}
        [X \oplus H, &f\cdot (Y \oplus \Theta)] =\\
        &= [X \oplus H, fY \oplus f\Theta] \\
        &=  [X, fY] \oplus \{X(f\Theta) - fY(H) + [H, f\Theta]\} \\
        &= (f[X, Y] + X(f)\,Y) \oplus \{X(f)\,\Theta + f\,X(\Theta) - fY(H) + f[H, \Theta]\} \\
        &=f([X, Y] \oplus \{ X(\Theta) -Y(H) + [H, \Theta]\} ) + (X(f) Y \oplus X(f)\Theta) \\
        &= f[X \oplus H, Y \oplus \Theta] + a(X \oplus H)f \, (Y \oplus \Theta)
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

The vector bundle $TM \times (M \times \algeb g)$ together with the previously defined anchor and bracket is called \emph{the trivial Lie algebroid on $M$ with structure algebra $\algeb g$}.

\subsubsection{Explicit Examples}

\subsection{The Adjoint Bundle of a Principal Bundle}

Or more generally $B \times \algeb g / G$ for a bundle $B$ in which $G$ acts to the right.

The subfamily of examples we will be most interested in is the family of $P \times \algeb g/G$ where $P$ is a principal bundle over a manifold $M$ with structure (Lie) group $G$, whose Lie  algebra is $\algeb g$. This bundle may be thought of as follows: given a point $p \in P$, a lie group element $A$ may be thought of as an infinitesimal direction in which we may move from $p$, as $A$ is an infinitesimal group element which prompts an infinitesimal movement in $P$ by the group action\improvement{Improve: I think ``infinitesimal action'' is a standard thing. The infinitesimal word may need a revision or change.} We will also see that, furthermore, any vertifical infinitesimal direction of movement can be encoded by an element of $P \times \algeb g$. Additionally, we had seen in \ref{} how a connection form is equivalent to a  a v.b. map $TP/G \to P \times \algeb g/G$ which is a section of the inclusion map (we called this maps connection reforms). \dbbox{REWRITE NICE ALL OF THIS, BUT INCORPORTATE IT}.


\begin{itemize}
    \item $P \times \algeb g/G$ is a ($C^\infty(M)$) vector bundle over $M$ (The same 3.1.1. proposition that may be used to prove that $TP/G$ is so can be used to prove this)
    
    \item Anchor: $0$ anchor works trivially
    
    \item Lie Bracket: fiberwise structure: the fiberwise (over $P$) bracket of $P \times \algeb g$, and it is easily seen (at least in the matrix Lie algebras, although it shouldn't be difficult to prove that $ad$ commutes with $[,]$ which allows to prove this well definition for any Lie algebra)
    
    \item Compatibility 1: trivial
    
    \item Compatibility 2: trivial
    
    \item $P \times \algeb g/ G \to TP / G$ is a ($C\infty(M)$) vector bundle morphism over $M$ (this is also proved generally by proposition 3.1.2.). Furthermore:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is injective... It is a submersion?
        \item It respects the brackets on both sides
        \item Respects, trivially, the anchor.
        \item All of this allows us to see that $P \times g/G$ corresponds to the vertical infinitesimal directions.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item So we may regard $P \times \algeb g / G = ker a$, and not only as a vector bundle map, but, thanks to the respect for the anchor and, specially, the Lie bracket, we may regard $P \times \algeb g/G$ as a sub Lie algebroid of $TP/G$.
\end{itemize}
