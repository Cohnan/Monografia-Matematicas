% Relevant to me:

% $\int_A := \int_{inner} \int_{outer}$, defined for both forms $\Omega(A, L)$ and $\Omega(A)$ (for the decomposition? Or when is that used?). Used for below:

%     \begin{itemize}
    
%     \item For $\hat \omega \in \Omega^1(A, L)$, define $S_{Gauge}[\hat \omega] = (\hat R, \hat R) = \int_A h(\hat R, \star \hat R)$.
    
%     \item For $\phi \in \Gamma(E)$ and $\hat \omega$ as above, \[S_{Matter}[\phi, \hat \omega] := (\hat \nabla^E \phi, \hat \nabla^E \phi)\]
    
%     \end{itemize}
    
% That means the star is needed for: 
%     \begin{itemize}
        
%     \item $\star \hat R$, where $\hat R \in \Omega^2(A, L)$
    
%     \item $\star \hat \nabla^E \phi$ for $\hat \nabla^E \phi \in \Omega^1(A, E)$
    
%     \item Some other forms of the same type that are generated by the decomposition

The formulation of a gauge theory on a transitive Lie algebroid $A$ will be made through the action functional $S[\phi, \hat \omega]$ of the theory, which will be the spacetime integral of the Lagrangian density, which is, in turn, the inner integral (definition \ref{}) of a scalar valued form on $A$, a form found as the a product of vector valued forms induced by a metric on the representation vector bundle.

Let every vector space, and hence every vector bundle, be over the field $\bb K$, where $\bb K$ is one of $\RR$ or $\CC$. Throughout this chapter let $0 \to L \xrightarrow{j} A \xrightarrow{a} TM$ be a transitive Lie algebroid for the transitive Lie algebroid $A$ over the manifold $M$.

(Assume $M$ is connected and) let $\{\}$ be a Lie algebroid atlas for $A$, where $\alg g$ is a Lie algebra\todo{I'm not sure I have been careful with the single typical fiber thing.} with basis $\{E_a\}_{a = 1, \dots, n}$ and associated dual basis $\{\epsilon^a\}_{a = 1, \dots, n}$.

Also, let $E$ be a vector bundle over $M$ on which $A$ is represented by $\phi: A \to \alg D(E)$, with vertical component $\phi_L: L \to \End(E)$. Suppose that $E$ is trivialized over each $U_i$, $i \in I$, by the vector bundle isomorphisms $\beta_i: U_i \times V \to E|_U$, where $V$ is a vector space with basis $\{e_u\}_{u = 1, \dots, t}$ and associated dual basis $\{\tilde e_u\}_{u = 1, \dots, t}$.\todo{Take this as example for all previous instances of this concepts and their labels}.

\section{Degenerate Metrics on Representation Vector Bundles and Inner Metrics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{definition}
    Let $E$ be any vector bundle over $M$. \emph{A degenerate metric on $E$} on $E$ is a symmetric vector bundle map $h^E: E \otimes E \to \bb K$. If $h^E$ is non-degenerate, i.e. if $h^E(\mu, \mu) = 0$, only if $\mu = 0$, then $h^E$ is called \emph{a metric on $E$}.
    
    In the case that $E = L$ the adjoint Lie algebroid of $A$, we also use the names \emph{degenerate inner metric on $A$} and \emph{inner metric on $A$}, respectively.
\end{definition}

Notice that a (degenerate) metric on $E$ is equivalent to a $C^\infty(M)$-linear map $h^E: \Gamma(E) \otimes \Gamma(E) \to C^\infty(M)$ which is a field of symmetric bilinear forms if $h^E$ is degenerate, and a field of metrics in the non-degenerate case. We now return to consider $E$ as a representation vector bundle of $A$.

For the rest of the chapter, let $h^E$ be a degenerate metric on $E$ and let $h$ be a degenerate inner metric on $A$.

\begin{definition}
    Over the trivializing neighborhood $U_i$, \emph{the components of $h^E$ with respect to the basis $\{e_u\}$}, with $u, v = 1, \dots$, are the functions $h^{E, i}_{u, v}:= h^E|_{U_i}(\beta_i(e_u),\beta_i(e_v)) \in C^\infty(U_i)$, where $e_u$ and $e_v$ are the corresponding constant $V$-valued functions on $U_i$.
\end{definition}

In particular, $h_{ab}$ are the components of $h$ with respect to the basis $\{E_a\}$, $a, b = 1, \dots, n$. Notice that, in contrast to the components of forms, the components of a (degenerate) metric are symmetric on the indices.

\begin{proposition}
Let ${H^i_j}^u_v = \tilde e^u(\beta^i_j(e_v))$, for $i, j \in I$ and $u, v \in \{1, \dots, t\}$ be the matrix representation of the transition function of $E$ from $U_j$ to $U_i$. Then,
\begin{equation}
    h^{E, j}_{u_1 u_2} = {H^i_j}^{v_1}_{u_1}{H^i_j}^{v_2}_{u_2} h^{E, i}_{v_1 v_2}
\end{equation}
for $u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2 \in \{1, \dots, t\}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
    h^{E, j}_{u_1 u_2} 
        &= h^E(\beta_j(e_{u_1}),\beta_j(e_{u_2})) \\
        &= h^E(\beta_i \comp \beta^i_j(e_{u_1}), \beta_i \comp \beta^i_j(e_{u_2})\\
        &= h^E({H^i_j}^{v_1}_{u_1} \beta_i(e_{u_2}), {H^i_j}^{v_1}_{u_1} \beta_i(e_{u_2}))
        &= {H^i_j}^{v_1}_{u_1}{H^i_j}^{v_2}_{u_2} h^{E, i}_{v_1 v_2}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
Recall that the transition functions of $L$ are denoted by $\alpha^i_j$ and its matrix representation with respect to $\{E_a\}_{a = 1, \dots, n}$ is denoted by ${G^i_j}^a_b$.

\begin{definition}\todo{Not sure if this map is non-degenerate IFF the vanilla $h^E$ is so}
    Given a degenerate metric on the representation vector bundle $E$ of $A$, let
    \begin{equation}
        h^E: \Omega^p(A, E) \otimes \Omega^q(A, E) \to \Omega^{p+q}(A)
    \end{equation}
    for all $p, q \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$ be the skew-symmetric $C^\infty(M)$-linear (family of) map defined by
    \begin{eqnsplit}
        h^E(\omega, \eta)(\oid X_1, \dots, \oid X_{p+q}) := \frac{1}{p!q!} \sum_{\sigma \in Sym_{p+q}} 
        h^E\left( \omega(\oid X_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, \oid X_{\sigma(p)}),  \eta(\oid X_{\sigma(p+1)}, \dots, \oid X_{\sigma_{p+q}}) \right),
    \end{eqnsplit}
    for all $\omega \in \Omega^p(A, E)$, $\eta \in \Omega^q(A, E)$, and $\oid X_1, \dots, \oid X_{p+q} \in A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $\alpha, \beta \in \Omega_{U_i}^\bullet(A)$, and let $\mu_1, \nu \in \Gamma_{U_i}(E) = \Omega^0_{U_i}(A, E)$. Then
\begin{equation}
    h^E(\mu \alpha, \nu \beta) = h^E(\mu, \nu) \, \alpha \wedge \beta.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
This is a direct consequence of the bilinearity of $h^E$  and how the formula for $h^E$ applied to forms is a generalization of the formula for the wedge product.
\begin{align*}
    h^E(\mu \alpha, \nu \beta)&(\oid X_1, \dots, \oid X_{p+q})\\
    &=\frac{1}{p!q!} \sum_{\sigma \in Sym_{p+q}} h^E\left( \mu \omega(\oid X_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, \oid X_{\sigma(p)}),  \nu \eta(\oid X_{\sigma(p+1)}, \dots, \oid X_{\sigma_{p+q}}) \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{p!q!} \sum_{\sigma \in Sym_{p+q}} 
        h^E\left( \mu ,  \nu  \right) 
        \omega(\oid X_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, \oid X_{\sigma(p)}) \eta(\oid X_{\sigma(p+1)}, \dots, \oid X_{\sigma_{p+q}})\\
    &= h^E(\mu, \nu) \, (\omega \wedge \eta)(\oid X_1, \dots, \oid X_{p+q}).
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

The previous proposition may be applied to the components of $E$-valued forms on each $U_i$ with respect to the basis $\{e_u\}$, since then $\omega = \omega^u e_u$ and $\eta = \eta^v e_v$ with $\omega^u$ and $\eta^v$ are scalar valued forms; hence
\begin{equation}
    h^E|_{U_i}(\omega, \eta) = h^{E,i}_{uv}\,\omega^u \wedge \eta^v 
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
A degenerate metric $h^E$ on $E$ is called \emph{compatible with the representation} if
\begin{equation*}
    h^E(\phi_L(\eta) \mu_1, \mu_2) + h^E(\mu_1, \phi_L(\eta)\mu_2) = 0,
\end{equation*}
for all $\eta \in L_m$ and $\mu_1, \mu_2 \in E_m$ for all $m \in M$.

In the case that $E$ is the adjoint Lie algebroid $L$, we also say that \emph{$h$ is a Killing degenerate metric}.
\end{definition}

Since the representation of $A$ on $L$ is is the adjoint representation, a Killing inner (degenerate) metric $h$ satisfies, for all $m \in M$, $\eta, \theta, \gamma \in L_m$:
\begin{equation}
    h([\eta, \theta], \gamma) = h(\theta, [\eta, \gamma]) = 0.
\end{equation}

\section{Degenerate Metrics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{definition}
\emph{The inner part of $\hat g$} is the degenerate inner metric \begin{equation}
    h := j^*g.
\end{equation} If $h$ is non-degenerate, $\hat g$ is called \emph{an inner non-degenerate metric on $A$}.
\end{definition}

Let $g$ be a (degenerate) metric on $TM$, i.e. a (degenerate) metric on $M$, then we may define a degenerate metric $\hat g$ on $A$ by
\begin{equation}
    \hat g = a^* g;
\end{equation}
this is a degenerate metric on $A$ since its inner part is null.

\begin{definition}
Let $\nabla: TM \to A$ be an ordinary connection on $A$ with induced connection form $\alg a \in \Omega^1(A, L)$. Then:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Given an inner degenerate metric $h$ on $A$, \emph{the degenerate metric induced by $\nabla$} is
    \begin{equation}
        \hat g := \alg a^* h;
    \end{equation}
    this metric has $h$ as inner part.
    
    \item Given a degenerate metric $\hat g$ on $A$, \emph{the tangent degenerate metric induced by $\nabla$} is the degenerate metric $g$ on $TM$:
    \begin{equation}
        g := \nabla^* \hat g.
    \end{equation}
    
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
An inner non-degenerate metric $\hat g$ on $A$ is equivalent to a triple $(g, h, \nabla)$ through the equation
\begin{equation}
    \hat g(\oid X, \oid Y) = g(a(\oid X), a(\oid Y)) + h(\alg a(\oid X), \alg a(\oid Y));
\end{equation}
where $g$ is a degenerate metric on $TM$, $h$ is an inner non-degenerate metric on $A$ and $\nabla$ is an ordinary connection on $A$ with associated connection $1$-form $\alg a$. In particular, $h$ is the inner part of $\hat g$ and $g$ is the tangent degenerate metric on $TM$ induced by the connection.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For a given triple $(g, h, \nabla)$, the corresponding degenerate metric is precisely $\hat g = a^*g + \alg a^* h$.

For the converse, let $\hat g$ be an inner non-degenerate metric on $A$. Then, let $h$ be the inner part of $\hat g$. We now need to see that an inner non-degenerate metric induces an ordinary connection $\nabla$ for which the vertical bundle of $A$ and the horizontal bundle induced by the connection are orthogonal, i.e. a connection such that
\begin{align}
    \hat g(\nabla_X, j(\eta)) &= 0,& \text{for all $X \in TM$ and $\eta \in L$};
\end{align} then, $g$ will simply be the tangent degenerate metric induced by $\hat g$. To prove this we follow an adapted version of Riesz representation theorem \todo{}.
\end{proof}


Suppose that on $U_i$ there is are coordinates $x^\mu: U_i \to \RR$ for $M$, with $\mu, \nu \in \{1, \dots, m\}$. Let $\hat g$ be an inner non-degenerate metric on $A$ associated to the triple $(g, h, \nabla)$. Then, with respect to the local frame $\{\nabla_\mu, -E_a\}$ of $TU_i \times \alg g$, dual to $\{dx^\mu, \alg a^a\}$, the following is true for the following scalar valued functions, called \emph{the local components of $\hat g$ with respect to the coordinates $x^\mu$ and the basis $\{E_a\}$} of $\alg g$, where $\mu, \nu = 1, \dots, m$ and $a, b = 1, \dots, n$:
\begin{align*}
    \hat g^i_{\mu \nu}& := \hat g^i(\nabla_\mu, \nabla_\nu) = \delta_{\mu \nu}\\
    \hat g^i_{\mu a} &:= \hat g^i(\nabla_\mu, -E_a)=0\\
    \hat g^i_{ab} &:= \hat g^i(-E_a, -E_b) = \delta_{ab}
\end{align*}
where $g^i := S^{i*}\hat g|_{U_i}$ is \emph{the local trivialization of $\hat g$ over $U_i$}, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \hat g^i = g_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu\otimes dx^\nu + h_{ab} \alg a^a \otimes \alg a^b.
\end{equation}


\section{Inner Integration and Integration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{definition}
The transitive Lie algebroid \emph{$A$ is inner orientable} if the adjoint Lie algebroid $L$ is an orientable vector bundle.
\end{definition}

Since the matrices ${G^i_j}^a_b$ represent the transition functions of $L$, where $a, b \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ and $i, j \in I$ such that $U_{ij \neq \empty}$ , $A$ is inner orientable if and only if $det({G^i_j}) \geq 0$.

For the rest of the section, let $A$ be inner orientable, and let $\hat g$ be an inner non-degenerate metric on $A$ with $(g, h, \nabla)$ its associated triple.

\begin{proposition}\label{propositionInnerVolumeFormIntegrationFOrmGloballyDefinedWell}
For $i, j \in I$ such that $U_{ij \neq \empty}$,
\begin{equation*}
    \hat \alpha^i_j(\sqrt{|h^j|} \alg a_j^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alg a_j^n) = \sqrt{|h^i|} \alg a_i^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alg a_i^n \in \Omega^n(TU_{ij} \times \alg g),
\end{equation*}
where $\alg a = \alg a_i^a E_a$ is the connection form associated to $\nabla$, and $|h^i| \in C^\infty(U_i)$ denotes the absolute value of the determinant of $h$ over $U_i$, which is simply the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix $(h_{ab})$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\todo{}
\end{proof}

Thanks to the previous proposition, the following form is well defined globally:
\begin{definition}
The global form $\omega_{h, \alg a} \in \Omega^n(A)$ whose local trivializations with respect to the connection $\nabla$ and the basis $\{E_a\}$ over each $U_i$ are
\begin{equation*}
    (\omega_{h, \alg a})_i = (-1)^n \sqrt{|h^i|} \alg a_i^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alg a_i^n
\end{equation*}
is called \emph{the inner volume form of $A$} with respect to $h$ and $\nabla$ and, recall, $n = dim(\alg g)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{theoremIntegratedFormFactorInnerVolumeFOrmWellGloballyDefined}
Suppose that $\beta \in \Omega^\bullet(A, E)$, and let its decomposition with respect to the connection $\nabla$ and the basis $\{E_a\}$ over $U_i$ be
\begin{equation*}
    \beta_i = \beta^{M}_i \wedge \omega_{h, \alg a}%(-1)^n \sqrt{|h^i|} \alg a_i^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alg a_i^n 
    + \beta^R,
\end{equation*}
where $\beta^R$ is the sum of the terms which do not have $\alg a_i^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alg a_i^n$ as a factor. Then, $\beta_i^M \in \Omega_{U_i}(A, E)$ is the local trivialization over $U_i$ of a globally defined form $\beta^M$.

Furthermore, $\beta_i^M$ is also the term of the decomposition of $\beta$ over $U_i$ that multiplies the maximum inner degree term $\sqrt{|h_i|} \epsilon^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \epsilon^n$, hence $\beta^M$ only depends on $h$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Thanks to the homogeneous transformation rules \ref{}, for all $j \in I$ such that $U_{ij} \neq \empty$, $\hat \alpha^i_j(\beta^R)$ does not have any term with $\alg a_j^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alg a_j^n$ as factor, and so, since $\hat \alpha^i_j$ respects the wedge product, proposition \ref{propositionInnerVolumeFormIntegrationFOrmGloballyDefinedWell} implies that
\begin{equation}
    \hat \alpha^j_i(\beta^{M}_i) = \beta^{M}_j.
\end{equation}

The last part of the theorem is follows simply from decomposing each $\alg a_i^a \in \Omega^1(TU_i \times \alg g)$ as $A_i^a - \epsilon^a$, showing that the term that accompanies $\epsilon^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge^n$ in the decomposition of $\beta$ with respect to the local frame $\{dx^\mu, \epsilon^a\}$, if it exists, is precisely the same term that accompanies $(-1)\alg a_i^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alg a_i^n$ in the decomposition of $\beta$ with respect to the frame $\{dx^\mu, \alg a^a\}$, where $x^\mu: U_i\to \RR$, $mu = 1, \dots , m$ are any (auxiliary) coordinates defined in perhaps smaller open subsets of $U_i$ that cover it; since $\hat \alpha^i_j(dx^\mu) = dx^\mu$, it does not matter that the coordinates $x^\mu$ are not defined globally.
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}
On the inner orientable transitive Lie algebroid $A$ with inner non-degenerate metric $\hat g$, define \emph{the inner integration of forms on $A$} as the operation:
\begin{align}
    \int_{inner} &: \Omega^\bullet(A) \to \Omega^\bullet(TM)
    & \beta &\mapsto \beta^M,
\end{align}
where we used the notation of proposition \ref{theoremIntegratedFormFactorInnerVolumeFOrmWellGloballyDefined}.
\end{definition}
The previous definition can be extended with the same formula to integration of $E$-valued forms, but we only state this definition since it suffices for our purposes of defining the action functional of a gauge theory.

\begin{definition}
The transitive Lie algebroid $A$ is called \emph{orientable} if it is inner orientable and the base manifold $M$ is orientable.\todo{This coincides with the $A = TM \oplus L$ being orientable as a vector bundle, right? or is this weaker?}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $A$ be an orientable transitive Lie algebroid with inner non-degenerate metric $\hat g$. Define \emph{the integration of scalar valued forms on $A$} as the operation
\begin{align}
    \int_A: \Omega^\bullet(A) &\to \bb K
    & \beta \mapsto \int_M \int_{inner} \beta,
\end{align}
applied to forms for which the corresponding integration over $M$ is well defined.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Notice that the integration on $A$ only requires an inner metric $h$ on $A$ and an orientable base manifold; neither $g$ nor the connection $\nabla$ influence the integration of forms on $A$. However, to define an action functional we will require one more ingredient: the Hodge-$*$ operator of forms, and this will require the full complexity of $\hag g$.
