They always exist.

If the algebroid is regular.

\section{$A$-Connections / Covariant Derivatives in ``Generalized Associated/Representation Algebroids''}

This concept of $A$-connection is introduced by Fernandes (either this, or their notion of $A$ connection is completely different from this one, but still reproduces the ordinary covariant derivative if we have a $TM$-connection). In his 2001 paper he remarks some important things about them, like how parallel transport does not depen only on the base path, the holonomy of a flt $A$-connection may be non-discrete, etc (pg. 7)

Horizontal lift of $\mathfrak{X}$ in $e\in E$? Linear vector field associated to derivation?
