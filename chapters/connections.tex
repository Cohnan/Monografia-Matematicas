Recall:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Lifting of Paths gives lifting of Vector fields
    
    \item Sections of associated vector bundles are really $G$-equivariant $\psi(pg) = g^{-1} \psi(p)$ functions $P \to V$. In general, \dbtext{forms $\Omega^n(TM, E)$ are $V$ valued equivariant forms $\Omega_G(P, V)$?}, 
    
    and this may? be the same as considering the associated vector bundle with fiber $\bigwedge^n V$, but I don't think it matters to me right now.
    
        \begin{itemize}
        
        \item The action of $G$ on $V$ determines uniquely the associated vector bundle
        
        \item ``Conversely'', at least up to what I did by hand, having a single section of a vector bundle, and having a representation of $G$ on the fiber determines the cocycles, which in turns determines the principal bundle, so: ``the vector bundle $E$ with fiber $V$ + the representation of a group $\Longrightarrow$ determines the Principal Bundle''... so, \textbf{even if I start simply with a vector bundle and a group that acts in the fiber, I obtain a principal bundle}, and so I may see a seciton as an equivariant function $:P \to V$.
        
        \item This is interpreted as locally choosing a ``frame'' or local trivialization, so that I may, locally, consider the section as simply $:U \subset M \to V$, as it is perceived ``physically''.
            
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{I want a ``covariant'' derivative of sections of $E$ to be something that sends $G$-equivariant funtions $:P \to V$ to $G$-equivariant functions},  given only $X \in TM$, because it is the manifold we see, on which $E$ is based. (In GR covariant means sending a tensor field to a tensor field)
    
    \item \textbf{This last point explains the $G$-equivariance of the principal connections!!} (see my example).
    
    \end{itemize}


---
The classical setting for Covariant derivate: 

    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Given a vector bundle $E$ over $M$ and
    
    \item a (Lie algebroid) connection $\nabla: TM \to \mathcal D(E)$ 
        
        \begin{itemize}
        
        \item weaker than a Lie algebroid representation because it is not required to be a Lie algebra morphism in the sections, unless the curvature is $0$
        
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item the Covariant Derivative \emph{of vector (bundle) valued forms} $\Omega^n(TM, E)$, $D^\nabla: \Omega^\cdot \to \Omega^{\cdot+1}$, e.g. $0$-forms, which are precisely $\Gamma(E)$, the matter fields. (The covariant is satisfied by definition, at least in the sense of GR, where it means to send a tensor field into a tensor field)
    
    \item is given precisely by the formula of the formula of the exterior derivative: Koszul formula
    
    Take into account that instead of having a representation of $TM$ in $E$ (which would define an exterior derivative) we have a connection.
    \end{itemize}
    
In summary, a covariant derivative 
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Is something defined on vector bundle valued forms, just like the exterior derivative $d$ (as defined in Lazzarini, at least).
    
    \item Is coarser than a $d$ by only requiring a (Lie algebroid) connection, instead of a representation (so no Lie algebra morphism in the sections)
    
    \item Is finer than a $d$ by requiring as starting vector bundle $TM$, instead of any Lie algebroid $A$.
    
    \end{itemize}

\section{Ordinary Connections and Curvature in Transtive Lie Algebroids}

They always exist.

If the algebroid is regular.

The ordinary curvature is (see descriptions in \ref{chp:understand}, in \ref{ordinaryCurvatureIs}). It satisfies \ref{BianchiandInhomogeneous}. It gives sense of horizontality \ref{ordinaryHorizontality}.

Is our notion of curvature somehow redundant? \ref{curvatureRedundant}

What meaning may be given to \ref{whatMeaning}


\subsection{Equivalence for Atiyah Lie Algebroid to Principal Bundle Theory}

Mackenzie does this in detail.

The general equivalence of $G$-equivariant/invariant forms on $TP$ and Lie algebroid forms has been established in Ch 2. THe normalized part is easy.

$\omega_{loc}(\cdot \oplus 0)$ is a local principal connection form.

\subsection{Local Description of connection and curvature and ``Change of Gauge''}

Ordinary Lie algebroid connection, i.e. $\omega \circ j = - id_L$

\begin{align}
    \omega^j_{loc}(X \oplus \eta) 
    &= \omega^j_{loc}(X) - \eta !!\text{$\omega(S(\cdot \oplus 0))$ is a local principal connection}\\
    &= \underbrace{\alpha^j_i(\omega^i_{loc}(X)) + \chi^j_i(X)}_{\text{same as the ppal. connection $\omega(S(\cdot \oplus 0))$}}- \eta
\end{align}

Generalized connections: $\omega \circ j = \tau - id_L$

\begin{align}
\omega^j_{loc}(X \oplus \eta) 
 = \underbrace{\alpha^j_o)\omega^j_{loc})(X)) + \chi^j_i(X) - \eta}_{\text{same as before}} + \psi_j^{-1}\circ \tau (\psi_j(\eta) - l^j_i(X))\\
\end{align}

The extra bit can also be written as 
\begin{align}
    \psi_j^{-1}\circ \tau \circ j^{-1}S_i(\eta) \\
    \psi_j^{-1}\circ \tau \circ j^{-1}\psi_i(\eta^i) & \text{if $\eta$ is understood as $\eta = \eta^j$}
\end{align}

These all means that
\begin{proposition}
A family of local $1$-forms with the above transformation rules $\equiv$ a (generalized) Lie algebroid connection on $A$
\end{proposition}

\section{Covariant Derivatives of Forms}

\section{$A$-Connections / Covariant Derivatives in ``Generalized Associated/Representation Algebroids''}

This concept of $A$-connection is introduced by Fernandes (either this, or their notion of $A$ connection is completely different from this one, but still reproduces the ordinary covariant derivative if we have a $TM$-connection). In his 2001 paper he remarks some important things about them, like how parallel transport does not depen only on the base path, the holonomy of a flt $A$-connection may be non-discrete, etc (pg. 7)

Horizontal lift of $\mathfrak{X}$ in $e\in E$? Linear vector field associated to derivation?

Do they give rise to good ``covariant derivatives''? (In associated bundles) \ref{trulyCovariant}



%\subsection{Infinitesimal Gauge Action}
\subsection{Local Description}
\subsection{Decomposition of a Generalized Connection and its Curvature}
}

What we really want: 
matter fields 
on which groups acts <- “local” gauge transformation associated to a group: Representation v. bundles of a transitive Lie algebroid $A ~ TM x \alg g$
on which there is a notion of covariant derivative (momentum: w.r.t space, energy: w.r.t. time -> Time Evolution Equations), 
where the covariance means that $D_X\psi$ is indeed again a matter field 
that  transforms as one under a “local gauge transformation”:
pointwise action of the group: 
including: change of local principal bundle trivialization
making the Matter Action invariant under local gauge transformations
And where the covariant derivatives induce the existence of observable Gauge Fields like light
whose Gauge Action is again invariant under local gauge transformations
Hence,
Principal bundle introduced as the bigger space where the X in TP has a natural and consistent notion of derivative: generalized by representation of A=TP/G on E
Where the group and its action on the vector fields plays an important role in the representation
SEE HOW DOES THE TRADITIONAL ACTION OF TP ON E LOOKS AS A REPRESENTATION OF TP/G, and notice how the group action intervenes
Generalized by: the lie algebra “of the structure group” is the vertical part of every transitive Lie algebroid, so a representation must take into account this infinitesimal gauge transformations
The “local gauge transformations” induced on E related to the group are generated by the infinitesimal gauge transformations $L~C^\infty(M, g)$ of A
And from where each connection induces a covariant (under gauge transformations) derivative on all associated matter fields: generalized covariant derivatives: $A$-connections
Furthermore! The new directions on which we may take covariant derivatives ARE PRECISELY THE COUPLINGS WITH THE TAU (“Higgs”) FIELD.

What I don’t need:
The notion of horizontality in $TP/G$: we care about 
the gauge fields (and tau fields) that the connections generate; and
the notion of covariant derivative that it induces on associated matter fields coming from horizontal vector fields will be replaced by 
representation to talk about the natural action, and of 
A-connections to introduce the direction preferred by the gauge fields
The principal bundle: 
the structure group as generator of gauge transformations is still there; 

the natural notion of TP as derivatives is generalized by the notion of representation (so the horizontality is again unnecessary)
Takeaway: even though I lose the view of connections as a notion of horizontality that is equivalent which helps make intuitive sense of connections as vertical projections and of the covariant derivatives as horizontal derivatives, its generalization purely in terms of forms completely suffices to incorporate the ingredients that are important for Gauge Theory, and allow the natural introduction of new fields tau that couple with the rest of the fields to make mass terms appear in the lagrangians.

        \item Ordinary connection IFF $\hat \Theta \comp j = 0$. If that is the case, then $\hat \theta^2 = \hat \theta$ is the horizontal projection of the horizontal lift $\nabla$.
        
        From the properties $\nabla$ horizontal lift, $\hat \omega$ vertical projection onto horizontal and vertical subbundles of $A$. We lose the intuition of horizontality, but we will still have a generalized notion of covariant derivatives which will give rise to the additional field that may couple with the gauge fields and the matter to give them mass. If it were desired, $\hat \theta$ is still a projection iff $\hat \omega \circ j|_{Im \hat \,\omega} = - 1|_{Im \, \hat \omega}$, e.g. $\hat \omega = 0$, then $\tau = -1_L$ and $\hat \Theta$ is a projection onto all of $A$.

\section{Connections on Transitive Lie Algebroids}    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Throughout this section consider $A$ to be a transitive Lie algebroid over the manifold $M$, and $0 \to L \xrightarrow{j} A \xrightarrow{a} TM \to 0$ be a Lie algebroid sequence of $A$; suppose all the vector bundles on this section have vector spaces over $\bb K$ as typical fibers, where $\bb K$ is one of $\RR$ or $\CC$.

\begin{definition}
\emph{An ordinary connection on $A$} is a right splitting $\nabla: TM \to A$ (i.e. a section of $a$) as vector bundles of the short exact sequence
\begin{equation}\label{equationDefinitionConnectionRightSplittingNablaSectionAnchorShortExactSequence}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    0 \arrow{r} & L \arrow{r}{j} & A \arrow{r}{a} & TM \arrow{r} \arrow[bend left]{l}{\nabla} & 0.
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
For any $X \in TM$, the application of the connection is written as $\nabla_X \in A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $\nabla:TM \to A$ be an ordinary connection on $A$. It has associated a unique $L$-valued, surjective one form $\omega \in \Omega^1(A, L)$ such that
\begin{equation} \label{equationRelationNablaOmegaOfOrdinaryConnection}
    \nabla_X = \sectoid X + j \comp \omega(\sectoid X),
\end{equation}
for all $\oid X \in A$ with $X = a(\oid X)$. In particular,
\begin{equation}\label{equationNormalizedOneFormOrdinaryConnectionOnTransitiveAlgebroid}
    \omega \circ j = - 1_{L};
\end{equation}
that is, $-\omega$ is a left splitting (i.e. a retract of $j$) of \eqref{equationDefinitionConnectionRightSplittingNablaSectionAnchorShortExactSequence} as a short exact sequence of vector bundles.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For any $\oid X \in A$, with $X = a(\oid X)$, $a(\nabla_X - \oid X) \in ker(a)$, so we can define the one form 
\begin{equation}\label{equationPreciseDefinitionOrdinaryConnectionFormUnique}
    \omega(\oid X) := j^{-1}(\nabla_X - \oid X);
\end{equation}
since the Lie algebra bundle morphism $j$ is injective, this $\omega$ is the only vector bundle morphism that satisfies \eqref{equationRelationNablaOmegaOfOrdinaryConnection}.

For any $l \in L$, $\omega(j(l)) = j^{-1}(- j(l)) = - j \comp j^{-1}(l) = -1$, proving the first equation, and therefore the surjectivity of $\omega$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
On the transitive Lie algebroid $A$ there is at least one ordinary connection.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is simply a restatement of the known fact that the short exact sequence \eqref{equationDefinitionConnectionRightSplittingNablaSectionAnchorShortExactSequence} in the category of vector bundles is split, which is equivalent to the statement that \begin{equation}
    A \cong TM \oplus L
\end{equation}
as vector bundles. To prove this last fact, we follow a standard partition of unity argument: let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover that trivializes $TM$, $L$ and $A$ simultaneously; then, on each $U \in \{U_\alpha\}$, there is a vector bundle isomorphism $f_\alpha: A|_U \to TM|_U \oplus L|U$. Now take a partition of unity $\{\rho_\alpha:U_\alpha \to [0,1]\}$ subordinate to it; then $\sum_\alpha \rho_\alpha f_\alpha : A \to TM \oplus L$ is a vector bundle isomorphism.

%Although we may now see this to be true thanks to the existence of a Lie algebroid atlas for $0 \to L \to A \to a \to a$ stated in theorem \ref{algebroidAtlasExists}, recall that the proof of that statement was not within the scope of this text. 
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Let $G \to P \to M$ be a principal bundle over the manifold $M$ with structure Lie group $G$. On a principal bundle the notion of connection has multiple statements, including 
\end{example}
