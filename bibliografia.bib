We use this local description to introduce global structures like metrics, â‹†-Hodge operation and integration along the algebraic part of the transitive Lie algebroid (its kernel). We construct a {\v{C}}ech-de Rham bicomplex with a Leray-Serre spectral sequence. We apply the general theory to Atiyah Lie algebroids and to derivations on a vector bundle.},
