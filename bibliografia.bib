abstract = {In this paper we introduce and study some mathematical structures on top of transitive Lie algebroids in order to formulate gauge theories in terms of generalized connections and their curvature: metrics, Hodge star operator and integration along the algebraic part of the transitive Lie algebroid (its kernel). Explicit action functionals are given in terms of global objects and in terms of their local description as well. We investigate applications of these constructions to Atiyah-Lie algebroids and to derivations on a vector bundle. The obtained gauge theories are discussed with respect to ordinary and to similar noncommutative gauge theories. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this chapter some differential geometric formulas, which will be of importance later on, will be derived. A certain degree of familiarity with the concepts of differential geometry is assumed since the choice of topics presented in this chapter is very one-sided. The main purpose is to derive some relations connected with the Laplacian and gradient first. In the third section, some basic notions of Riemannian geometry have to be introduced for the future treatment of applications in the context of elliptic or parabolic problems. In the following we shall frequently write v for a vector with components Vi. The summation convention will be used throughout this chapter also. Thus, for instance, the scalar product v w will also be written as ViWi. {\textcopyright} 1981, Academic Press Inc.},

abstract = {We introduce and study the notion of representation up to homotopy of a Lie algebroid, paying special attention to examples. We use representations up to homotopy to define the adjoint representation of a Lie algebroid and show that the resulting cohomology controls the deformations of the structure. The Weil algebra of a Lie algebroid is defined and shown to coincide with Kalkman's BRST model for equivariant cohomology in the case of group actions. The relation of this algebra with the integration of Poisson and Dirac structures is explained in [3].},

They provide rigorous frameworks to describe Yang-Mills-Higgs theories or gravita-tion theories, and each of them improves the paradigm of gauge field theories. A brief comparison between them is carried out, essentially due to the various notions of connection. However they reveal a compelling common mathematical pattern on which the paper concludes.},
