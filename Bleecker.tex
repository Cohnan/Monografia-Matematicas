\section{Very Important Facts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If we have a ``particle field''/wave function $\psi:M \to V$, where $V$ is vector field, \emph{there is an implicit choice of reference frame} (perhaps for zero-phase angle, or for axes of isospin)!!
    
    \item Thus, what we really have is a ``frame'' bundle $P$ and $\psi:P \to V$, where \rtext{$\psi(p)$ means the measurement of $V$ \emph{with respect to $p$}} (not talking simply about the frame bundle).

    \item \lbbox{A gauge}: \emph{a continuous choice of reference frame}: a local section of the principal bundle. 
    
    \item \rtext{Given a gauge, we may thus say, locally, $\psi(m)$, for $M$ in $P$}
    
    \item \rtext{Connections/Gauge potentials are needed to construct truly gauge invariant action densities from a wave function}, which are is required to have gauge fields (like the vector potential field).
    
    \item \rtext{Principal bundles and connections also allow to geometrize forces: JUST LIKE GRAVITY geometrizes gravity} by adding a ``'time'' dimension, the additional dimmensions of the principal bundle can be seen as the \rtext{``charge'' dimensions}. \rtext{A geodesic in the principal bundle} \small{spacetime metric in $M$ \otext{plus connection} induce metric in $P$} \rtext{projects to a 3d trajectory of a charged particle under the corresponding force!!}
    
    \item \rtext{GRAVITY MAY BE SEEN AS AN EXTERNAL GAUGE THEORY where the gauge symmetry is the change of the points in $M$ themselves: diffeomorphisms}. This is in contrast to the usual/internal gauge theorie, where the spacetime points are left intact and the variation occurs in the internal degrees of freedom.
    
    \item The action density is the scalar curvature. \rtext{Einstein Field equations are obtained by imposing the action density be invariant under changes of metric in $M$!!}, similarly \rtext{Yang-Mills equations arise from invariance under variation of gauge potential (connection)!!}
\end{itemize}
