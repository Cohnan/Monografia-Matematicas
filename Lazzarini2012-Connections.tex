\subsection{Differential structures (pg. 4)}

$\Omega^p(A, E)$ defined

$d$ defined

3 important families of examples:

    \begin{itemize}
        
    \item $(\Omega^\bullet(A), \hat d_A)$
    
    \item $(\Omega^\bullet(A, L), \hat d)$: generalized connections in $A$
    
    \item $(\Omega(A, \Gamma End(E)), \hat d_E)$: $A$-connections on $E$.
        
    \end{itemize}

NOT done, but should be no problem: wedge (I think it is implicity, sinec they call this differential ALGEBRAS)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cartan operations (pg. 6)}

$\iota_{\mathfrak X}$ (an internal derivative) makes possible definition of Lie derivative, of horizontal forms, invariant forms and basic forms.

Apparently this is important to characterize differential forms on Atiyah Lie algebroids in 4.2.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Gauge transformations (pg. 6)}

Gauge group of a vector bundle is the group of its vector bundle automorphisms: $Aut(E)$. Usually (Bleecker), the gauge group is defined as the group of principal bundle automorphisms of the Principal bundle (so $G$-equivariant and fiber preserving), and it is in bijective correspondence to $G$ equivariant, I think, functions $C(P, G)$.

An infinitesimal gauge transformation on a transitive Lie algebroid $A$ is an element $\xi$ of the adjoint bundle... if $A$ is represented in an $E$, $\xi$ acts vertically on $E$. IN THE ATIYAH Lie algebroid case, this is the usual infinitesimal gauge transformation: an element of $C(P, \mathfrak g) \equiv \Gamma(P \times \mathfrak g/G)$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Connections (pg. 7)}

Ordinary connections in $A$ and curvature as forms. Covariant derivative of $L$ valued forms $\Omega(A, L)$. Infinitesimal gauge action on connectionand curvature.

$A$-connection on $E$ $:A \to \mathfrak D(E)$. Curvature. It an affine space model over the vector space $\Omega^1(A, \Gamma End(E))$. As forms \[\Omega(A, \Gamma End(E))\]. Finite gauge action.

Generalized connection $1$-form on $A$. Curvature. Induces $A$-connection in associated vector bundles. Infinitesimal gauge action, ``defined in a coherent way'' with the finte gauge action on $A$-connections.

\section{Relation to ordinary geometry and noncommutative geometry (pg. 11)}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Trivial Lie algebroid (pg. 11)}

$(\Omega(A), \hat d_A)$ as $(\Omega(M)\otimes \bigwedge g^*, d + s)$.

$(\Omega(A, L), \hat d)$ as $(\Omega(M)\otimes \bigwedge g^* \otimes \mathfrak g, d + s')$ : \[(\Omega_{TLA}(M, \mathfrak g), \hat d_{TLA})\]!!.

$E$ also trivial. $(\Omega(A, \Gamma End(E)), \hat d_E)$ as $\Omega(M)\otimes \bigwedge g^* \otimes \Gamma(E)$. Denoted by \[ (\Omega_{TLA}(M, \mathfrak g, E), \hat d_{E}) \]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The Atiyah Lie algebroid of a principal bundle (pg. 13)}

$(\Omega(A, L), \hat d)$ a $(\Omega_{TLA}(P, \mathfrak g)_{equ}, \hat d_{TLA})$, and mention that it is also $(R, Ad)$-equivariant forms in $(\Omega(P) \times \mathfrak g, d)$. Denoted by: \[ (\Omega_{Lie}(P, \mathfrak g), \hat d) \]

How do ordinary connection and curvature forms look here.

How do generalized connection $1$-forms look.

$(\Omega(TP/G, \Gamma End(E)), \hat d_E)$ as $((\Omega_{TLA}(P, \mathfrak g, E)_{equ}, \hat d_{E}))$. Then $TP/G$-connections on $E$ as $1$-form in $\Omega(P, \mathfrak g, E)$.

    \alpha^i_j(\eta) &= g_{ij} \eta g^{-1}_{ij} \\
    \chi^i_j(X) = g_{ij} dg^{-1}_{ij}(X)
